But one thing all agree on is that ending up a meal for one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into their deadly lairs.</p><p>Though the deep crow most immediately resembles a massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avian insect.

Incubation lasts a year, followed by a year during which the fledgling deep crows stay close by their parent's side.

He is known for his furious skill in battle, and for his propensity to fall asleep as soon as a fight is done (as well as countless other inopportune times). More immediately notable is the unique physical trait that all members of his clan bear-a stylish tail that is rare and often considered a deformity among dragonborn.</p><p>As with his tail, an odd quirk of heritage makes Donaar's acid breath more of a signature vomiting, giving rise to a driving paranoia that this regurgitation might damage his teeth. As testaments to his obsession with dental hygiene, Donaar named his greatsword Toothbrush and calls his whip Floss. He carries an actual toothbrush (named Percival) and actual floss at all times.</p><p>Those who know Donaar quickly come to recognize that the braggadocio that defines him involves a certain amount of artifice. When the young dragonborn left his clan and family to adventure in foreign climes, he realized that doing so provided the perfect opportunity to reinvent himself for folk who had no idea what he was once like. As such, Donaar has learned that no amount of bravado and compensation is too much-provided he leaves no openings for strangers to call him on it. By the same token, strangers quickly come to realize that reinforcing Donaar's self-congratulating sense of draconic entitlement makes it remarkably easy to win his favor.</p><p>Despite his easily massaged vanity, the dragonborn sometimes shows the occasional streak of selflessness. Most notably, Donaar serves in his off-hours as parttime godfather to a young dragonborn named Chronaar, who had inadvertently imprinted on Donaar as a parental figure while he watched over her while she was in her egg.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic good","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"dragonborn","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":5,"source":"AI"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["acid"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common","draconic","orc"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"his":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":4,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":2,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"prototypeToken":{"displayName":20,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"name":"Donaar Blit'zen","texture":{"src":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/AI/Donaar Blit'zen.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"sight":{"enabled":true,"range":0,"brightness":1,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"detectionModes":[]},"items":[{"_id":"wg1I5p5haTFi8BGH","name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<p>Donaar makes two attacks with his greatsword or his whip.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"AI","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"other","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/blade-tips-triple-steel.webp","flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"monsterAction","source":"AI","hash":"multiattack_donaar%20blit'zen_ai_ai"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"system":{"description":{"value":"<p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+5]] (+5) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 10 ([[/r 2d6 + 3]]) slashing damage.

Tapped into this dark power, the \"C\" Team's hoards person sees all existence as a puzzle to unlock, and he is obsessed by the essential lack of meaning and purpose in the structures of so-called \"reality.\" Still, all things considered, he is most often polite and affable. Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can't afford to make more enemies.</p><p>Given his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K'thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow's hair jet-black. His matching \"beard\" is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K'thriss believes makes him look distinguished. Possessed of alarming and asymmetric crystalline eyes, he often wears a blindfold to spare others his visage, seeing through the eyes of his familiar while he does.</p><p>Tentacles play a big part in K'thriss's spellcasting, whether wrenching him through the sky when he uses magic to fly, or manifesting in dark, suckered form when he casts spells such as thorn whip. And when enemies hear K'thriss whisper the deep truths of the Ur-typically something about how on a geologic time scale, everyone's desires are meaningless-they remember it.</p><p>K'thriss's familiar, Ligotti, is a semisapient remnant of a tentacle attack, spawned by the warlock's intercessor patron god. Though entirely alien to the material plane (and often appearing in the form of a staff), Ligotti uses the stat block of a poisonous snake with these changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li

But this is a mix-up that few people make more than once. Patient and studious, Rosie has schooled more than one malcontent with what the halfling refers to as \"the sauce\"-a whirlwind of kicks and punches to one or the other haunches that can inspire even the toughest half-orc to sprint toward anyplace Rosie isn't. As an increasing number of folk hear the tales of her prowess, the \"C\" Team cartographer's fame among her fellow halflings has become nothing short of legendary. Still, this adoration might be augmented by the sheer number of halflings related to Rosie. She has a daunting number of natural and adopted children, many of whom have followed their mother along the adventuring career track.</p><p>Rosie's goals have always been more complex than merely seeking after adventure. She has long sought for ultimate meaning in the stars, and to seek justification for her belief that her bonds to her expansive family are reflected in the endless movements and intricate patterns of the sky. However, the Beestinger clan has a less metaphysical reputation in the eyes of many people, as constantly swirling rumors attempt to connect the family to various and nefarious halfling criminal enter prises.
