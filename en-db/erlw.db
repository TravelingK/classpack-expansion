A @condition[charmed] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">Belashyrra taps into the eyesight of creatures in its lair and alters their perception.

On a failure, the affected creature perceives objects and creatures a short distance from their actual locations, imposing disadvantage on the creature's attack rolls against those targets. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this lair action for the next 24 hours.</li></ul></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><h3 class=\"rd__h rd__h--2\" data-title-index=\"1577\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Regional Effects</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[–]</span></span></h3> <p>Belashyrra's lair is known to touch remote areas of the Shadow Marches and caverns below Xen'drik.

The Inspired are the most common type of willing host for the quori and are described earlier in this chapter.</p></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"lawful evil","race":"","type":{"value":"aberration","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":9,"spellLevel":0,"source":"ERLW"},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":["psychic"],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"bypasses":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["charmed","frightened"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":"Quori"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"arc":{"value":2,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"his":{"value":2,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ins":{"value":2,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"per":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"0","passive":""}}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null},"spell0":{"value":0,"override":null}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"prototypeToken":{"displayName":20,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"name":"Hashalaq Quori","texture":{"src":"https://5etools-mirror-1.github.io/img/ERLW/Hashalaq Quori.png","scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"rotation":0,"tint":null},"width":1,"height":1,"rotation":0,"actorLink":false,"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"sight":{"enabled":true,"range":60,"brightness":0,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"lockRotation":false,"alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"detectionModes":[]},"items":[{"_id":"1IDlrKLr1BNUu5f4","name":"Multiattack","type":"feat","system":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The quori uses its Mind Thrust twice.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"ERLW","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"other","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"flat"},"type":{"value":"","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"img":"icons/skills/melee/blade-tips-triple-steel.webp","flags":{"plutonium":{"page":"monsterAction","source":"ERLW","hash":"multiattack_hashalaq%20quori_erlw_erlw"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"system":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Melee Spell Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+8]] (+8) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 9 ([[/r 1d10 + 4]]) force damage.

Some stories say that she is served by a legion of undead and that she maintains a court of vampires and ghosts in her palace of ice. Other tales claim that when anyone dies in Lhazaar, Illmarrow chooses whether to take their soul before it passes on to the Keeper and Dolurrh.</p><p>But Lady Illmarrow is no folk tale. She is the greatest necromancer in Eberron, and after centuries of silence, she is setting ancient plots into motion at last. She is the power behind the Order of the Emerald Claw, but her motives for founding the order are buried in her past. Lady Illmarrow has no interest in ruling the living. Rather, she seeks to become Queen of the Dead.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1629\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Mark of Death.</span></span> <p>Illmarrow is a fiefdom on the isle of Farlnen—home to a community of elves exiled from Aerenal, who have practiced necromancy for centuries. But Lady Illmarrow's roots extend far beyond her island domain.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Long ago, it was revealed that the elven line of Vol—a house that practiced the art of necromancy and bore the Dragonmark of Death—was engaged in secret blood rites with a clan of dragons. The discovery of this pact triggered an unprecedented alliance between the Sibling Kings of Aerenal and the dragons of Argonnessen. The Sibling Kings proclaimed that House Vol would be exterminated to the last member, and the Mark of Death would be eliminated from the world.</p><p>The line of Vol had long been rivals of the Undying Court, and many whisper even today that the attack on House Vol was nothing more than an excuse to eliminate a political rival. But others believe that what the Undying Court truly feared was a path shown in the Draconic Prophecy—that a child born of dragon and elf could become a godlike avatar of death.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1630\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Illmarrow Rises.</span></span> <p>Even as dragons and elves fought to destroy the line of Vol, a child was born to the house: Erandis. A scion of elf and dragon, Erandis bore a Mark of Death unlike any other. In time, it might have been her gateway to immortality and unrivaled power, but she was hunted down and killed long before she could master the mark's magic. Her mother, Minara Vol, escaped with her daughter's body to the icy reaches of Farlnen, far from the conflict. There, Minara unleashed all her necromantic power to raise Erandis as a lich.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>As an undead being, Erandis lost the use of her dragonmark. Thus, when the diviners of Aerenal asked if the line of Vol had been exterminated and the Mark of Death destroyed, they received a vision affirming that the bloodline of Vol was no more. To the world, the last survivor of that bloodline is known as Lady Illmarrow. But in truth, she is Erandis Vol, heir to the Mark of Death.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1631\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trapped in Undeath.</span></span> <p>When Minara restored Erandis as a lich, she hid her daughter's phylactery, weaving enchantments into it that cause Erandis to be reborn in a random safe haven after she is destroyed.

Armies of dragons fought against the fiends of Khyber. And though the overlords couldn't be destroyed, the couatl sacrificed their lives to build a prison of celestial light: a silver flame that bound the overlords in Khyber once more.

They are the most powerful members of the Undying Court who still maintain their physical forms. While many undying councilors spend their days advising the living, some devote years projecting their consciousness into the Astral Plane, seeking new knowledge to share with their people. Still, not all minds are capable of assimilating immortality, and undying councilors sometimes buckle under the strain and go mad.</p></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>The undying are undead creatures sustained by positive energy or the devotion of mortal beings. Where strong negative emotions can trap a spirit as a ghost or wraith, the undying are spirits who linger because they are cherished and who in turn seek to protect and guide the people of their community.</p><p>Though it's possible for undying to appear anywhere, it is rare for them to manifest naturally. The only place where they are found in significant numbers is the island of Aerenal, a land whose close ties to the plane of Irian suffuse it with positive energy. The elves of Aerenal spent thousands of years working to develop rituals that tap into this energy, allowing them to preserve their greatest citizens as undying.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1720\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Face of Death.</span></span> <p>The light of Irian sustains the spirit, but it doesn't preserve the physical body. The undying appear as desiccated corpses, their flesh withering away over centuries. At the same time, the spirit of the undying surrounds the body—an aura of light forming a spectral shadow of the soul. The light shed by an undying doesn't generate heat, but it provides a sense of warmth and comfort.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>The most powerful of the undying can separate their spirits from their physical forms, existing as beings of pure light. This state is the ultimate goal of the elves of Aerenal, and such beings are known as ascendant councilors.</p></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1721\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Bound by Love and Light.</span></span> <p>Undying are sustained by positive energy, whether found in manifest zones tied to Irian—such as in Shae Mordai, the Aereni City of the Dead—or freely given by the devotion of mortal beings. The worship of the Undying Court is what sustains the undying of Aerenal, but devotion is a finite resource. As such, each elf that becomes an undying must earn their afterlife. If an undying elf leaves Aerenal, they require a community of elves or another source of positive energy to sustain them. Failing this, their light fades and they eventually die.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"1722\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">The Undying Court.</span></span> <p>The honored undead of Aerenal are united in the Undying Court.

These beings of pure light are focused on contemplating the mysteries of life and the planes, and can work together to wield godlike power that allows them to shield Aerenal from almost any threat.

The DM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the creature's ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.

The only place where they are found in significant numbers is the island of Aerenal, a land whose close ties to the plane of Irian suffuse it with positive energy.

The worship of the Undying Court is what sustains the undying of Aerenal, but devotion is a finite resource. As such, each elf that becomes an undying must earn their afterlife. If an undying elf leaves Aerenal, they require a community of elves or another source of positive energy to sustain them.
