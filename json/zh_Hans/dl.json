When death stills such a creature’s heart and snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda.<br><br> Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction.<br><br><strong><em> Life Eaters.</em></strong> Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things. When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight’s cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.<br><br><strong><em> Shadow of the Grave.</em></strong> Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell.

Dancers. Ever.”</em><br> —Riddlefiddle the Satyr, on ogres</blockquote></div> <div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26119178/gUYL9L5wzBVilz5UuWES6w/med.png?1481324438\"></div><h2>Ogres</h2> Ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.<br><br> <strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre’s wrath in an instant—as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.<br><br> <strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre?has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br><br> <strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.<br><br> <strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words—and then being eaten in turn.<br><br> <strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.<br><br> An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.<br><br> <strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.<br><br> Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants’ complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Greatclub</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br> <strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br> <strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NjQyMzFlMzEwMDhl]{Invasion of Vogler}</li></ul></section>"

The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith’s horrifying existence.<br><br><strong><em> Vile Oblivion.</em></strong> When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith—a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith’s former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life.<br><br><strong><em> Bereft of Body.</em></strong> A wraith can move through solid creatures and objects as easily as a mortal creature moves through fog.<br><br> A wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they were as a reminder of what they have become.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Commanders.</em></strong> A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter, spiteful of all that lives.<br><br> Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith’s armies are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A wraith doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br> <strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Life Drain</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.<br><br> <strong>Create Specter</strong>: The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a specter in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The specter is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YWFiZWM5YTE1Yjdl]{Raided Catacombs}: R2</li><li>@JournalEntry[ZDU3MDQ4Mzg0OTkx]{E: Wakenreth}: E2</li><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S14</li></ul></section>"

Once a Solamnic Knight of the Order of the Rose, Soth was a paragon of virtue and justice who allowed his pride to lead him down an evil path. The gods gave Soth a chance at redemption, charging him with confronting the Kingpriest of Istar and averting the Cataclysm. However, he was undone by his pride, abandoned his quest, and allowed the Cataclysm to devastate Krynn. Soth perished during the Cataclysm but then rose from the ashes as an Undead horror. In his cursed castle, Dargaard Keep, Soth long ignored the ruined world, but the Dragon Queen’s summons has called his evil forth once more.</p><p>In battle, Soth is a terror, wielding the last remnant of the Cataclysm’s fires to devastating effect. He usually uses his spellcasting ability only as part of his legendary actions.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p><span><b><i>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</i></b> If Soth fails a saving throw, he </span><span>can choose to succeed instead.</span></p><p><span><b><i>Magic Resistance.</i></b> Soth has advantage on saving throws against </span><span>spells and other magical effects.</span></p><p><span><b><i>Marshal Undead.</i></b> Unless Soth is incapacitated, he and Undead </span><span>creatures of his choice within 60 feet of him are immune to features </span><span>that turn Undead.</span></p><p><span><b><i>Unusual Nature.</i></b> Soth doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.</span></p><p><b><i>Spellcasting.</i></b> Soth casts one of the following spells, requiring <span>no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting </span><span>ability (spell save DC 19):</span></p><p>At will: <i>command</i> (cast at 3rd level)<br><span>2/day each:</span><span> </span><i>dispel magic</i><span>,</span><span> </span><i>hold person</i><span> </span><span>(cast at 3rd level)<br></span><span>1/day:</span><span> </span><i>banishment</i><span> </span><span>(cast at 6th level)</span></p><h3>Actions</h3><p><span><b><i>Multiattack.</i></b> Soth makes three Forsaken Brand attacks.</span></p><p><span><b><i>Forsaken Brand.</i></b> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., </span><span>one target. <i>Hit:</i> 10 (1d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) </span><span>necrotic damage, and if the target is a creature, it can’t regain </span><span>hit points until the start of Soth’s next turn.</span></p><p><span><b><i>Cataclysmic Fire (1/Day).</i></b> Soth hurls a magical ball of fire that </span><span>explodes at a point he can see within 120 feet of himself.

The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.<br><br> <strong><em>The Spawning Stone.</em></strong> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone’s power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus’s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus’s massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.<br><br> The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn’t perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.<br><br> <strong><em>Birth and Transformation.</em></strong> Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.<br><br> <strong><em>Shapechangers.</em></strong> Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.<br><br> <h2>Green Slaad</h2> Green slaadi are surprisingly intelligent and possess innate spellcasting ability. A green slaad can change its shape to appear as a humanoid. If it was born of a humanoid host, the slaad usually adopts its host’s form.<br><br> At some unpredictable point in its existence, a green slaad unlocks the means to magically, instantly, and permanently transform itself into a gray slaad. Unlocking this knowledge can take years, even decades. <br><br> <h2>Variant: Slaad Control Gems</h2> As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad’s brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child’s fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad’s gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad’s gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.<br><br> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26545544/VGTI7rbFkH6SP4BxURj9aQ/med.png?1482355708\" alt=\"\">A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.<br><br> <strong>Control Gem</strong>: Implanted in the slaad’s brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.<br><br> Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against <em>imprisonment</em>, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster’s open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A <em>wish</em> spell, if cast in the slaad’s presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.<br><br> A <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.<br><br> Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br> <strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The slaad’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br> • At will: <em>detect magic, detect thoughts, mage hand</em><br> • 2/day each: <em>fear, invisibility</em> (self only)<br> • 1/day: <em>fireball</em><br><br> <strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br> <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or staff. Alternatively, it uses its Hurl Flame twice.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Slaad Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br> <strong>Claw (Slaad Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Staff</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.<em>伤害：</em>11（2d6+4）点钝击伤害。<br><br> <strong>Hurl Flame</strong>: <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (3d6) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.<p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NTRhOTNkYWE2NjM4]{Path of Memories}: M6</li></ul></section>"

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>"

Acquire it, and the slaad is yours to command.</em></blockquote><br> <div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26555914/Ddl4VctIFITT-tmyI8B_tA/med.png?1482375501\"></div><h2>Slaadi</h2> In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest and meadow, ruined castles, and isolated islands drift through a tumult of fire, water, earth, and wind. The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.<br><br> <strong><em>The Spawning Stone.</em></strong> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone’s power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus’s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus’s massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.<br><br> The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn’t perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.<br><br> <strong><em>Birth and Transformation.</em></strong> Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.<br><br> <strong><em>Shapechangers.</em></strong> Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.<br><br> <h2>Green Slaad</h2> Green slaadi are surprisingly intelligent and possess innate spellcasting ability. A green slaad can change its shape to appear as a humanoid. If it was born of a humanoid host, the slaad usually adopts its host’s form.<br><br> At some unpredictable point in its existence, a green slaad unlocks the means to magically, instantly, and permanently transform itself into a gray slaad. Unlocking this knowledge can take years, even decades. <br><br> <h2>Variant: Slaad Control Gems</h2> As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad’s brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child’s fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad’s gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad’s gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.<br><br> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26545544/VGTI7rbFkH6SP4BxURj9aQ/med.png?1482355708\" alt=\"\">A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.<br><br> <strong>Control Gem</strong>: Implanted in the slaad’s brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.<br><br> Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against <em>imprisonment</em>, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster’s open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A <em>wish</em> spell, if cast in the slaad’s presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.<br><br> A <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.<br><br> Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br> <strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The slaad’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br> • At will: <em>detect magic, detect thoughts, mage hand</em><br> • 2/day each: <em>fear, invisibility</em> (self only)<br> • 1/day: <em>fireball</em><br><br> <strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br> <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or staff. Alternatively, it uses its Hurl Flame twice.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Slaad Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.<br><br> <strong>Claw (Slaad Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Staff</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.<em>伤害：</em>11（2d6+4）点钝击伤害。<br><br> <strong>Hurl Flame</strong>: <em>Ranged Spell Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 60 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (3d6) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MmViNGY3NmM2NDBi]{D: Sunward Fortress}: D5</li></ul></section>"

When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>"

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br><br><strong><em> Animated Dead.</em></strong> Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.<br><br> While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br><br><strong><em> Obedient Servants.</em></strong> Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can’t read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br><br> A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.<br><br> Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren’t mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn’t work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br><br><strong><em> Habitual Behaviors.</em></strong> Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master’s control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can’t eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.<br><br> When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A skeleton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Charge</strong>: If the skeleton moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Greataxe</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Gore</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S3</li></ul></section>"

The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power. To do so, he must continually expand his infernal armies, sending his servants to the mortal realm to corrupt the souls from which new devils are spawned.<br><br><strong><em>Lords of Tyranny.</em></strong> Devils live to conquer, enslave, and oppress. They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment. Every interaction is an opportunity for a devil to display its power, and all devils have a keen understanding of how to use and abuse their power.<br><br>Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.<br><br><strong><em>Obedience and Ambition.</em></strong> In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.<br><br>At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.<br><br><strong><em>Dark Dealers and Soul Mongers.</em></strong> Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus’s will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.<br><br>To own a creature’s soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal’s soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.<br><br><h2>The Infernal Hierarchy</h2>The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.<br><br><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/301299520/9YuYerYmKc3zBDXZ0f8RKA/med.png\" alt=\"Devil Intro\">A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. He delegates most matters of rulership to the pit fiends and lesser archdevils that make up the infernal bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, even as he knows that those powerful devils conspire to usurp the Throne of Baator from which he rules. Asmodeus appoints archdevils, and he can strip any member of the infernal hierarchy of rank and status as he likes.<br><br>If it dies outside the Nine Hells, a devil disappears in a cloud of sulfurous smoke or dissolves into a pool of ichor, instantly returning to its home layer, where it reforms at full strength. Devils that die in the Nine Hells are destroyed forever—a fate that even Asmodeus fears.<br><br><strong><em>Archdevils.</em></strong> The archdevils include all the current and deposed rulers of the Nine Hells (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table), as well as the dukes and duchesses that make up their courts, attend them as advisers, and hope to supplant them. Every archdevil is a unique being with an appearance that reflects its particular evil nature.<br><br><strong><em>Greater Devils.</em></strong> The greater devils include the pit fiends, erinyes, horned devils, and ice devils that command lesser devils and attend the archdevils.<br><br><strong><em>Lesser Devils.</em></strong> The lesser devils include numerous strains of fiends, including imps, chain devils, spined devils, bearded devils, barbed devils, and bone devils.<br><br> <strong><em>Lemures.</em></strong> The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.<br><br><strong><em>Promotion and Demotion.</em></strong> When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil’s memories passing intact from one form to the next.<br><br>Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.<br><br><h3>Infernal Hierarchy</h3>1. lemure<br><br><strong>Lesser devils<br></strong>2. imp<br>3. spined devil<br>4. bearded devil<br>5. barbed devil<br>6. chain devil<br>7. bone devil<br><br><strong>Greater devils<br></strong>8. horned devil<br>9. erinyes<br>10. ice devil<br>11. pit fiend<br><br><strong>Archdevils<br></strong>12. duke or duchess<br>13. archduke or archduchess <br><br>Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories—and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.<br><br>No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other’s most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.<br><br><h3>The Nine Hells</h3>The Nine Hells are a single plane comprising nine separate layers (see the Layers and Lords of the Nine Hells table). The first eight layers are each ruled by archdevils that answer to the greatest archdevil of all: Asmodeus, the Archduke of Nessus, the ninth layer. To reach the deepest layer of the Nine Hells, one must descend through all eight of the layers above it, in order. The most expeditious means of doing so is the River Styx, which plunges ever deeper as it flows from one layer to the next. Only the most courageous adventurers can withstand the torment and horror of that journey.<br><br><h2>Devil True Names and Talismans</h2>Though devils all have common names, every devil above a lemure in station also has a true name that it keeps secret. A devil can be forced to disclose its true name if charmed, and ancient scrolls and tomes are said to exist that list the true names of certain devils.<br><br> A mortal who learns a devil’s true name can use powerful summoning magic to call the devil from the Nine Hells and bind it into service. Binding can also be accomplished with the help of a devil talisman. Each of these ancient relics is inscribed with the true name of a devil it controls, and was bathed in the blood of a worthy sacrifice—typically someone the creator loved—when crafted.<br><br> However it is summoned, a devil brought to the Material Plane typically resents being pressed into service. However, the devil seizes every opportunity to corrupt its summoner so that the summoner’s soul ends up in the Nine Hells. Only imps are truly content to be summoned, and they easily commit to serving a summoner as a familiar, but they still do their utmost to corrupt those who summon them. <br><br><h2>Bone Devil (Osyluth)</h2>Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted. At the same time, they long for promotion and are bitterly envious of their superiors, attempting to curry favor though it irks them to do so.<br><br>A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it. Though they are devastating in combat with their claws, bone devils also wield hooked polearms made of bone, which they use to subdue enemies before striking with their venomous tails. <br><br> <h3>Layers and the Lords of the Nine Hells</h3><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <strong>Layer</strong> </td><td> <strong>Layer Name</strong> </td><td> <strong>Archduke or Archduchess</strong> </td><td> <strong>Previous Rulers</strong> </td><td> <strong>Primary Inhabitants</strong> </td></tr><tr> <td> 1 </td><td> Avernus </td><td> Zariel </td><td> Bel, Tiamat </td><td> Erinyes, imps, spined devils </td></tr><tr> <td> 2 </td><td> Dis </td><td> Dispater </td><td> — </td><td> Bearded devils, erinyes, imps, spined devils </td></tr><tr> <td> 3 </td><td> Minauros </td><td> Mammon </td><td> — </td><td> Bearded devils, chain devils, imps, spined devils </td></tr><tr> <td> 4 </td><td> Phlegethos </td><td> Belial and Fierna </td><td> — </td><td> Barbed devils, bone devils, imps, spined devils </td></tr><tr> <td> 5 </td><td> Stygia </td><td> Levistus </td><td> Geryon </td><td> Bone devils, erinyes, ice devils, imps </td></tr><tr> <td> 6 </td><td> Malbolge </td><td> Glasya </td><td> Malagard, Moloch </td><td> Barbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps </td></tr><tr> <td> 7 </td><td> Maladomini </td><td> Baalzebul </td><td> — </td><td> Barbed devils, bone devils, horned devils, imps </td></tr><tr> <td> 8 </td><td> Cania </td><td> Mephistopheles </td><td> — </td><td> Horned devils, ice devils, imps, pit fiends </td></tr><tr> <td> 9 </td><td> Nessus </td><td> Asmodeus </td><td> — </td><td> All devils</td></tr></tbody></table> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Devil's Sight</strong>: Magical darkness doesn't impede the devil's darkvision.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The devil makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting, or the devil makes two attacks: one with its hooked polearm and one with its sting.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Sting</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.

Until this grapple ends, the devil can’t use its polearm on another target. <br><br><strong>Variant: Summon Devil (1/Day)</strong>: The devil chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. A bone devil has a 40 percent chance of summoning 2d6 spined devils or one bone devil. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can’t summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MDk1YjI4M2Q1ZjVh]{Threshold of the Heavens}: T2 (Guelfost)</li></ul></section>"

They fly on mighty wings over battlefields wherever the fighting is the fiercest, making them effective shock troops.

When sivaks are killed, their crumbling bodies mimic the form of their killers and shriek in agony.<br></p><h2>Draconians</h2><p>Draconians are bipedal monsters born from metallic dragon eggs that have been corrupted by a combination of warped alchemy and the Dragon Queen’s foul magic.

In one hand it clutched an iron sword, in the other, a feather whip. We should have turned back then.\"</em><br>—Mordenkainen the Archmage, chronicling his party’s harrowing exploits in the dungeons below Maure Castle</blockquote><p></p><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/301328184/7d9RALCo9V-P53WgC5NiQg/med.png\" alt=\"Clay Golem\"></div><br> <h2>Golems</h2> Golems are made from humble materials—clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone—but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator’s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.<br><br> To create a golem, one requires a <em>manual of golems</em> (see the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.<br><br><strong><em> Elemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem’s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.<br><br> After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem’s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.<br><br><strong><em> Ageless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.<br><br> A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.<br><br><strong><em> Blind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently—or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.<br><br> A golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.<br><br><strong><em> Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><blockquote><em>\"The more rigid its physical form, the less likely the golem is to lose its sense of purpose. The clay ones can be a bit twitchy.\"</em><br>—Words of warning in the <em>Manual of Clay Golems</em></blockquote> <br> <h2>Clay Golem</h2> Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and shoulders taller than most human-sized creatures. It is human shaped, but its proportions are off.<br><br> Clay golems are often divinely endowed with purpose by priests of great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel for life force. If the golem is damaged, the elemental spirit bound into it can break free. Such a golem runs amok, smashing everything around it until it is destroyed or completely repaired.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Acid Absorption</strong>: Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.<br><br><strong>Berserk</strong>: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.<br><br><strong>Immutable Form</strong>: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Magic Weapons</strong>: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The golem makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.<br><br><strong>Haste (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: Until the end of its next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.<br> <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NjZjYTE4YWQxZDU4]{Into the Wastes}</li></ul></section>"

These cunning opponents relish striking foes who are distracted or unaware. Kapaks often coat their weapons with their paralytic saliva, making them formidable assassins as well. Their small wings don’t allow kapaks to fly, but they do help the draconians turn a fall into a rough glide.

Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon’s treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon’s hoard.<br><br> A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature’s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon’s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.<br><br><strong><em> Solitary Shapeshifters.</em></strong> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.<br><br> Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.<br><br><strong><em> The Persistence of Memory.</em></strong> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon’s hoard three centuries before.<br><br><strong><em> King of Good Dragons.</em></strong> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries—actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.<br><br> Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.<br><br> <h2>Bronze Dragon</h2> Bronze dragons are coastal dwellers that feed primarily on aquatic plants and fish. They take the forms of friendly animals to observe other creatures of interest. They are also fascinated by warfare and eagerly join armies fighting for a just cause.<br><br> A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon’s head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales. A bronze wyrmling’s scales are yellow tinged with green; only as the dragon approaches adulthood does its color deepen to a darker, rich bronze tone. The pupils of a bronze dragon’s eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.<br><br><strong><em> Dragons of the Coast.</em></strong> Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely. A daring bronze dragon might slip aboard a ship in the guise of a bird or rat, inspecting the hold for treasure. If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship’s captain for the item.<br><br><strong><em> War Machines.</em></strong> Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.<br><br> When a conflict unfolds near its lair, a bronze dragon ascertains the underlying cause, then offers its services to any side that fights for good. Once a bronze dragon commits to a cause, it remains a staunch ally.<br><br><strong><em> Well-Organized Wealth.</em></strong> Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies’ means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.<br><br> <h2>A Bronze Dragon’s Lair</h2> A bronze dragon lairs in coastal caves. It might salvage a wrecked ship, reconstruct it within the confines of its lair, and use it as a treasure vault or nest for its eggs.<br><br> <h3>Lair Actions</h3> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:<br><br><ul><li>The dragon creates fog as though it had cast the <em>fog cloud</em> spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li><li>A thunderclap originates at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within a 20-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) thunder damage and be deafened until the end of its next turn.</li></ul> <br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region containing a legendary bronze dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic.<br><br><ul><li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn’t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the <em>control weather</em> spell.</li><li>Underwater plants within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair take on dazzlingly brilliant hues.</li><li>Within its lair, the dragon can set illusory sounds, such as soft music and strange echoes, so that they can be heard in various parts of the lair.</li></ul> <br> If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The dragon can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Tail</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Frightful Presence</strong>: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.该被恐慌生物可以在其自己回合结束时再进行一次该豁免，豁免成功则终止该生物身上的恐慌效应。 If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.<br><br><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons (lightning breath or repulsion breath):<br><br><div><strong>Lightning Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br><strong>Repulsion Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from the dragon.</div><br> <strong>Change Shape</strong>: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).<br><br>In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.<br><br><h2>传奇动作</h2>龙拥有3传奇动作，用来选择执行下列动作项。它每次只可选择执行一个传奇动作项，且必须在另一生物回合结束时执行。 The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.<br><br><strong>Detect</strong>: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.<br><br><strong>Tail Attack</strong>: The dragon makes a tail attack.<br><br><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.以该方式挥动翅膀后，该龙还可以因该动作向上方飞行至多等于其飞行速度一半的距离。<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NWQ2OWI2YjZmMzdm]{G: Heart's Hollow}: (Nezrah)</li></ul></section>"

Unlike other draconians, auraks are wingless. This might lull foes into a false sense of security, until the auraks exhale noxious fumes resembling those of their dragon progenitors. Auraks are masterminds and strategists that serve as commanders in the Dragon Armies. They often lead contingents of less powerful draconians. When slain, aurak draconians unleash their inherent magic in a deadly burst of lightning.<br></p><h2>Draconians</h2><p>Draconians are bipedal monsters born from metallic dragon eggs that have been corrupted by a combination of warped alchemy and the Dragon Queen’s foul magic. The Dragon Armies closely guard the secret of the draconians’ creation, allowing Krynn’s metallic dragons to continue to think their eggs are being held hostage so they don’t oppose the Dragon Queen’s conquests.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p><span><b><i>Aura of Command.</i></b> The draconian radiates a commanding presence </span><span>in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself.

For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.<br><br> The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.<br><br><strong><em> Ghostly Manifestations.</em></strong> Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A ghost doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Ethereal Sight</strong>: The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.<br><br><strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Withering Touch</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.<br><br><strong>Etherealness</strong>: The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.<br><br><strong>Horrifying Visage</strong>: Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a <em>greater restoration</em> spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.<br><br><strong>Possession (Recharge 6)</strong>: One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.<br><br>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YWU1MzlmMzE5Mzg0]{Final Farewell}</li><li>@JournalEntry[ODAyZDNmMmJhODdm]{The Lord's Arrival}</li><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S2</li></ul></section>"

In one hand it clutched an iron sword, in the other, a feather whip. We should have turned back then.\"</em><br>—Mordenkainen the Archmage, chronicling his party’s harrowing exploits in the dungeons below Maure Castle</blockquote><p></p><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/301328184/7d9RALCo9V-P53WgC5NiQg/med.png\" alt=\"Clay Golem\"></div><br> <h2>Golems</h2> Golems are made from humble materials—clay, flesh and bones, iron, or stone—but they possess astonishing power and durability. A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator’s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.<br><br> To create a golem, one requires a <em>manual of golems</em> (see the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.<br><br><strong><em> Elemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem’s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.<br><br> After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem’s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.<br><br><strong><em> Ageless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.<br><br> A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.<br><br><strong><em> Blind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently—or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.<br><br> A golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.<br><br><strong><em> Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br><blockquote><em>\"The more rigid its physical form, the less likely the golem is to lose its sense of purpose. The clay ones can be a bit twitchy.\"</em><br>—Words of warning in the <em>Manual of Clay Golems</em></blockquote> <br> <h2>Clay Golem</h2> Sculpted from clay, this bulky golem stands head and shoulders taller than most human-sized creatures. It is human shaped, but its proportions are off.<br><br> Clay golems are often divinely endowed with purpose by priests of great faith. However, clay is a weak vessel for life force. If the golem is damaged, the elemental spirit bound into it can break free. Such a golem runs amok, smashing everything around it until it is destroyed or completely repaired.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Acid Absorption</strong>: Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the acid damage dealt.<br><br><strong>Berserk</strong>: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.<br><br><strong>Immutable Form</strong>: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Magic Weapons</strong>: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The golem makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell or other magic.<br><br><strong>Haste (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: Until the end of its next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.<br> <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S4<br></li></ul></section>"

These cunning opponents relish striking foes who are distracted or unaware. Kapaks often coat their weapons with their paralytic saliva, making them formidable assassins as well. Their small wings don’t allow kapaks to fly, but they do help the draconians turn a fall into a rough glide.

As with many of Soth’s retainers, Caradoc was cursed with undeath. Being duplicitous and cowardly at his core, the seneschal didn’t return as a skeletal knight but rather as an intangible spirit. Caradoc’s Undead form suits him well, allowing him to possess the living and use unwilling tongues to spread his lies. However, Caradoc is tethered to his scorched bones, which collect dust in Dargaard Keep. He can leave the accursed castle while possessing the body of a Humanoid, but he’s swiftly pulled back if caught beyond its walls without a host.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p><span><b><i>Bound Haunting.</i></b> Caradoc’s spirit is bound to Dargaard Keep. </span><span>At the start of his turn, if he’s outside the keep’s walls and not </span><span>possessing a creature using his Possession action, he must </span><span>succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or vanish and reappear </span><span>in an unoccupied space within the keep.</span></p><p><span><b><i>Incorporeal Movement.</i></b> Caradoc can move through other creatures </span><span>and objects as if they were difficult terrain.

A form lurches into view, dragging one foot as it raises bloated arms and broken hands. The zombie advances, driven to kill anyone too slow to escape its grasp.<br><br><strong><em> Dark Servants.</em></strong> Sinister necromantic magic infuses the remains of the dead, causing them to rise as zombies that do their creator’s bidding without fear or hesitation. They move with a jerky, uneven gait, clad in the moldering apparel they wore when put to rest, and carrying the stench of decay.<br><br> Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can’t be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a resurrection spell.<br><br> A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.<br><br><strong><em> Hideous Forms.</em></strong> Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.<br><br><strong><em> Mindless Soldiers.</em></strong> Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.<br><br> A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won’t retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A zombie doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Undead Fortitude</strong>: If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage.<p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NzlhNTg2ZDVlY2U2]{Battle of Kalaman}</li></ul></section>"

A bristling mane stretches down the creature’s back, and its long tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range.<br><br> <strong><em>Evil Predators.</em></strong> Manticores are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to take down particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it uses its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are depleted.<br><br> A manticore isn’t particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature’s life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food.<br><br> <strong><em>Monstrous Relationships.</em></strong> Manticores serve wicked masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A manticore might provide aerial support for an orc horde or a hobgoblin army. Another could serve as a hunting companion for a hill giant chief, or guard the entrance to a lamia’s lair.<br><br> The manticores’ greatest territorial rivals include chimeras, griffons, perytons, and wyverns. Manticores hunting as a pack often have the advantage of greater numbers. In addition to these creatures, manticores fear dragons and avoid them.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Tail Spike Regrowth</strong>: The manticore has twenty-four tail spikes.

They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.<br><br> The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.<br><br>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.<br><br><strong><em> Mountain Masters.</em></strong> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.<br><br><strong><em> Arrogant Tyrants.</em></strong> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.<br><br> No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.<br><strong><em><br> Status and Slaves.</em></strong> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.<br><br> When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn’t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe’s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.<br><br><strong><em> Obsessive Collectors.</em></strong> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.<br><br> A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item’s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can’t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.<br><br> <h2>A Red Dragon’s Lair</h2> Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.<br><br>With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls—and the wider world it seeks to control.<br><br> Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered. <br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul><li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li><li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it.

Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.<br><br><strong><em> Living Elements.</em></strong> On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.<br><br><strong><em> Conjured by Magic.</em></strong> Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.<br><br><strong><em> Bound and Shaped.</em></strong> Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.<br><br> The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can’t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.<br><br><strong><em> Elemental Nature.</em></strong> An elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Air Elemental</h2> An air elemental is a funneling cloud of whirling air with a vague semblance of a face. Although it likes to race across the ground, picking up dust and debris as it goes, it can also fly and attack from above.<br><br> An air elemental can turn itself into a screaming cyclone, creating a whirlwind that batters creatures even as it flings them away.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Air Form</strong>: The elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The elemental makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6)</strong>: Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.<br><br>If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MGRmYzJlNjNlNjJi]{A: Wrecker's Edge}: </li><li>@JournalEntry[NTRhOTNkYWE2NjM4]{Path of Memories}: M9</li></ul></section>"

These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.<br><br> A blue dragon is recognized by its dramatic frilled ears and the massive ridged horn atop its blunt head. Rows of spikes extend back from its nostrils to line its brow, and cluster on its jutting lower jaw.<br><br> A blue dragon’s scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.<br><br><strong><em> Vain and Deadly.</em></strong> A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.<br><br> A blue dragon is a patient and methodical combatant. When fighting on its own terms, it turns combat into an extended affair of hours or even days, attacking from a distance with volleys of lightning, then flying well out of harm’s reach as it waits to attack again.<br><br><strong><em> Desert Predators.</em></strong> Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon’s eye.<br><br> When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.<br><br><strong><em> Overlords and Minions.</em></strong> Blue dragons covet valuable and talented creatures whose service reinforces their sense of superiority. Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.<br><br> A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.<br><br><strong><em> Hoarders of Gems.</em></strong> Though blue dragons collect anything that looks valuable, they are especially fond of gems. Considering blue to be the most noble and beautiful of colors, they covet sapphires, favoring jewelry and magic items adorned with those gems.<br><br> A blue dragon buries its most valuable treasures deep in the sand, while scattering a few less valuable trinkets in plainer sight over hidden sinkholes to punish and eliminate would-be thieves.<br><br> <h2>A Blue Dragon’s Lair</h2> Blue dragons make their lairs in barren places, using their lightning breath and their burrowing ability to carve out crystallized caverns and tunnels beneath the sands.<br><br> Thunderstorms rage around a legendary blue dragon’s lair, and narrow tubes lined with glassy sand ventilate the lair, all the while avoiding the deadly sinkholes that are the dragon’s first line of defense.<br><br> A blue dragon will collapse the caverns that make up its lair if that lair is invaded. The dragon then burrows out, leaving its attackers to be crushed and suffocated. When it returns later, it collects its possessions—along with the wealth of the dead intruders.<br><br> <h3>Lair Actions</h3> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul><li>Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone and buried. The buried target is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength check, ending the buried state on a success.</li><li>A cloud of sand swirls about in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</li><li>Lightning arcs, forming a 5-foot-wide line between two of the lair’s solid surfaces that the dragon can see. They must be within 120 feet of the dragon and 120 feet of each other. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) lightning damage.</li></ul> <br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region containing a legendary blue dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul><li>Thunderstorms rage within 6 miles of the lair.</li><li>Dust devils scour the land within 6 miles of the lair. A dust devil has the statistics of an air elemental, but it can’t fly, has a speed of 50 feet, and has an Intelligence and Charisma of 1 (−5).</li><li>Hidden sinkholes form in and around the dragon’s lair. A sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall 1d6 × 10 feet into the sinkhole.</li></ul> <br> If the dragon dies, the dust devils disappear immediately, and the thunderstorms abate within 1d10 days. Any sinkholes remain where they are.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales lightning in an 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide.

He views the Dragon Army as a way to recreate the glories of Ansalon’s past. During the Dragon Armies’ invasions of Khur and Kendermore, Lohezet’s investigations of Istarian ruins revealed the location of the flying city of Onyari. He now travels with the Red Dragon Army, intent on finding the City of Lost Names and restoring it to the skies.</p><p>Lohezet employs the strategies of extinct poisonous predators in battle. His magical toxins wear down even the strongest foes, providing him with the opportunity to escape or reducing his enemies to discolored corpses.</p><h3>Traits</h3><p><em><b>Toxic Mastery. </b></em>Lohezet ignores a creature’s resistance to poison damage.</p><p><em><b>Spellcasting.</b></em> Lohezet casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):</p><p>At will: <em>detect magic</em>, <em>light</em>, <em>presti</em><em>digitation<br></em><span>2/day each: </span><em>dimension door</em><span>, </span><em>mage armor<br></em><span>1/day each: </span><em>arcane eye</em><span>, </span><em>dominate person</em><span>, </span><em>wal</em><em>l of force</em></p><h3>Actions</h3><p><em><b>Multiattack. </b></em>Lohezet makes three Withering Blast attacks and uses Miasma if it’s available.

The area within the sphere is heavily obscured, and when a creature starts its turn in the sphere or enters the sphere for the first time on a turn, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 39 (6d12) poison damage and is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned. The cloud lasts for 1 minute, until Lohezet ends it early (no action required), or until Lohezet uses this action again. A strong wind disperses the cloud.</p><h3>Reactions</h3><p><em><b>Noxious Rebuke (3/Day).</b></em> When a creature within 60 feet of Lohezet damages him, Lohezet magically retaliates with a spray of foul, purple mist. The creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (2d10 + 5) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NDgyMDQ5YjI2NDM0]{Exploring the City}</li><li>@JournalEntry[MDk1YjI4M2Q1ZjVh]{Threshold of the Heavens}: T9</li></ul></section>"

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Dragons</h2>真龙是拥有古老血统和惊人力量的有翼爬行类。它们以狡诈贪婪的掠夺者形象而威名远扬，而最古老的龙也可以作为其所在世界最强大的生物。龙类还包含了其他一些天生具有强大力量，可以使用恐怖吐息武器或其它超自然能力的魔法生物。<br><br>许多生物（包括飞龙 wyverns 和龙龟 dragon turtles）都拥有龙族血统。而真龙则只包括金属龙和色彩龙两大类别。黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙全都自私邪恶，而又令人恐惧。黄铜龙、青铜龙、赤铜龙、金龙和银龙则体现着高贵与善良，而且睿智又令人敬畏。<br><br>尽管它们的目标和理想千差万别，但所有的真龙都贪恋财富，会收集成堆的钱币并收集宝石、首饰和魔法道具。囤积了大量财宝的龙不大部分时间都呆在其宝库中，而只有在巡视和觅食时才会走出其巢穴。<br><br>真龙的整个生命周期贯穿其四个不同的年龄阶段，一条龙从弱小的雏龙到远古龙可以存活长达一千年。在此期间，它们的实力将逐渐变得无可匹敌，而其财富也会超值增长。<br><br><h3>龙的年龄层Dragon Age

Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters</h2>龙作为天生的魔法生物，其随着年龄的增长可能会逐渐掌握一些法术，此时便可以使用该变体。<br><br>一条青年龙或更年长的龙天生可以施展的法术数量等同于其魅力调整值。每个法术每日只能施展一次，且不需任何材料成分，而该法术的环阶也不能超过这条龙挑战等级的三分之一（向下取整）。该龙的法术攻击加值等于其熟练加值＋其魅力调整值。该龙的法术豁免DC等于8＋其熟练加值＋其魅力调整值。<br><br><h2>色彩龙 Chromatic Dragons</h2>黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙代表着龙类邪恶方势力。好斗、贪婪、自负的色彩龙是黑暗贤者或强大暴君，以恐惧压迫众生——包括它们的同类。<br><br><strong><em>贪婪为动力 Driven by Greed。</em></strong>色彩龙迷恋财宝，这种贪婪本质会贯彻它们的每项计划和阴谋中。它们认为自己有权占有世界上所有的财富，因此色彩龙抓获这些被类人或其他生物“偷”走的财宝时无需半点迟疑。这些成堆的钱币、耀眼的宝石和魔法装备，即是传说中的巨龙宝库。此外，色彩龙对商务活动毫无兴趣，其积累财富单纯是为了拥有而并非为了其他。<br><br><strong><em>自负的生物 Creatures of Ego。</em></strong>色彩龙们一致承认自身族类的优越性，相信自己是凡间生物中的至高志强者。与其他生物互动时，它们也只关注自身利益的得失。色彩龙们坚信自己具有与生俱来的统治权，而这种信念正是其世界观的基石。让色彩龙谦虚就如同说服风停止吹动。在它们看来，类人生物只是动物，只适合作为猎物和驮兽且完全不值得尊重。<br><br><strong><em>危险的巢穴 Dangerous Lairs。</em></strong>龙的巢穴相当去其权利的宝座，也是其储存财宝的宝库。虽然龙类可以凭着其天生的耐性与韧性承受各种恶劣环境效应，但它们还是筑起巢穴以作防守而非安居。此外，这些巢穴都会设置多个出入口，其内还为其宝库设置了安保措施。<br><br>色彩龙的巢穴大多建在危险的偏远地区，以防止那些最大胆的凡人前来拜访。黑龙会将巢穴建在一片广阔沼泽中央，而红龙则可能占据活火山的喷发口作其巢穴。除依靠大自然防御巢穴外，一些强大的色彩龙还会使用魔法守卫、陷阱和其他顺从的生物作为巢穴的护卫。<br><br><strong><em>恶龙女王Queen of Evil Dragons。</em></strong>龙后提亚马特Tiamat the Dragon Queen是邪恶龙类的主神。她定居于九层地狱的第一层 阿佛纳斯Avernus中。作为一名弱等神力，提亚马特可以授予其崇拜者法术，只是她并不喜欢分享自己的力量。她是所有恶龙贪婪的集合体，自认为多元宇宙和其中所有的宝藏终有一天都将成为她独享的所有物。<br><br> 提亚马特是一头体型庞大的巨龙。它的五颗头颅反映了崇拜她的色彩龙——黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙。她的五种吐息武器可以消灭一整支军队，加上其可怕的施法能力以及骇人的龙爪使其成为战场上的恐惧之源。<br><br> 提亚马特最痛恨的敌人，铂金龙巴哈姆特Bahamut the Platinum Dragon，同时也是与她分享所有龙类信仰的存在。另外，她也保留着对阿斯蒙蒂斯Asmodeus的特殊恨意——后者在很久之前，为了限制龙后的力量而剥夺了她对阿佛纳斯的统治权。<br><br><h2>黑龙 Black Dragon</h2>作为色彩龙中最暴躁卑劣的种类，黑龙会将倒毙者的残骸连同其财宝一同收集起来。黑龙们厌恶眼见弱者的兴盛，并乐见类人生物王国崩溃。恶臭的沼泽，以及覆亡王国曾经耸立的废墟瓦砾会是它们理想的家园。<br><br>深陷的眼窝和显眼的开放性鼻孔使得黑龙看起来酷似骷髅。它那弯曲、分节的双角在根部附近为骨白色的，而越靠近末端就越变暗为死黑色。随着黑龙年龄的增长，它双角和颧骨周围的皮肉就像是被强酸侵蚀了一样，退化直至只剩下薄薄的一层皮肤，并因此更特显其骷髅一般的外貌。黑龙头上带有标志性的尖刺和犄角。它扁平的舌头在末端分叉，强酸味的粘稠流涎增强了黑龙身上那混杂着腐烂植被与污水的恶臭。<br><br>在刚孵化时，黑龙拥有乌黑发亮的鳞片。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片会变得厚实而暗淡，以让其融入到家园的沼泽和崩塌废墟之中。<br><br><strong><em>野蛮而残忍 Brutal and Cruel。</em></strong>所有的色彩龙都是邪恶，而黑龙更因其残虐的本性而显得格外突出。观赏猎物求饶即是黑龙的生活乐趣，而它们也时常为敌人制造可以喘息或逃跑的假象。<br><br> 黑龙会优先攻击最弱的敌人，以确保能迅速而残暴的获胜，并以此令剩下的敌人感到恐惧和满足其自负心理。在快要战败时，黑龙会做不择手段的保全自己。而且在它认命受死之前，黑龙决不允许任何人凌驾其上。<br><br><strong><em>敌人与奴仆 Foes and Servants。</em></strong>黑龙憎恨并恐惧其他龙族。它们从远处窥探作为对手的龙类，以此伺机杀死较弱者并回避与强者遭遇。如果一头更强的龙对其造成威胁，黑龙会放弃其巢穴而前去寻找新的领地。<br><br> 邪恶的蜥蜴人 lizardfolk 崇拜并臣服于黑龙。它们会洗劫类人生物定居点，并将得来的财宝和食物用作贡品。它们还会制作粗糙的龙形塑像，并安置于其黑龙主子领地的周边区域。<br><br>黑龙本身的恶意还会影响周围扎堆而来的邪恶原始生物，使它们主动寻找并杀戮出现在黑龙巢穴的善良生物。<br><br>许多黑龙巢穴内会像虫子一样滋生着狗头人。这些群体受其黑暗主人影响而越来越残忍，时常在将俘虏们带去给黑龙填肚子前，用蜈蚣叮咬和蝎子蜇刺对其施行折磨削弱。<br><br><strong><em>远古的财富 Wealth of the Ancients。</em></strong>黑龙囤积来自崩溃帝国和被征服王国的宝藏和魔法物品，并以此彰显自己的伟大。黑龙活过的时间经历过越多的文明，其对当前文明意欲索取的财富名目就越是繁多。<br><br><h2>黑龙巢穴 A Black Dragon’s Lair</h2>黑龙居住在文明地区边缘，那些经常发生摩擦的沼泽中。黑龙的巢穴是一处阴暗的洞穴，石窟或者至少是被部分淹没的废墟，其内通常设有供黑龙休息的水池，而受害者的残骸也会在其中发酵。龙穴中到处都是死去受害者被强酸侵蚀的骸骨，苍蝇萦绕的新鲜死尸，以及守望在其内的残损塑像。巢穴四处出没着蜈蚣、蝎子和蛇，还散发着死亡与腐朽的恶臭。<br><br><h3>巢穴动作 Lair Actions</h3>先攻轮到20时（出现等值时视为后手），该龙可执行一个巢穴动作并产生下列效应其一。它不能在连续两轮里重复使用同一种效应：<br><br><ul><li>黑龙周边120尺范围内它能看见的水池涌起卷人的浪潮。任何身处水池周围20尺内地面上的生物都必须进行一次DC 15的力量豁免，豁免失败者将被往水池内拖动至多20尺并因此倒地。</li><li>黑龙指定其周边120尺范围内一点，并以虫群凝成一云团充满以该点为中心的一个半径20尺的球状区域。虫云充满区域的每个角落，并一直持续到该黑龙以一个动作将其解散。再次使用该巢穴动作或黑龙死亡时虫云也会随之消散。虫云产生轻度遮蔽。虫云出现时，任何处于其范围内的生物都必须进行一次DC 15的体质豁免。豁免失败者将受到10（3d6）点穿刺伤害，豁免成功则伤害减半。在该团虫云中结束其回合的生物会受到10（3d6）点穿刺伤害。</li><li>黑龙指定其周边60尺范围内一点，并以魔法黑暗弥漫以该点为中心的一个半径15尺的球状区域。黑暗充满区域的每个角落，并持续存在直至该黑龙以一个动作将其驱散。再次使用该巢穴动作或黑龙死亡时黑暗也会随即消散。拥有黑暗视觉的生物无法看穿这片黑暗，非魔法的光亮也无法将其照亮。任何2环或更低环阶法术所制造的光亮如果与该效应区域重叠，则这些法术所创造的光亮将被驱散。</li></ul><br><h3>区域效应 Regional Effects</h3>这片区域由于其内一个传奇黑龙的巢穴而被魔法扭曲，造成了下列一项或多项的效应：<br><br><ul><li>巢穴附近6里内的陆地由于其内植被生长茂盛而繁杂，以及其内沼泽覆盖着厚重的淤泥，使得穿行通过该区域所需的时间翻倍。</li><li>巢穴附近1里内的所有水源都被超自然的力量所腐坏。龙的敌人在喝下这样的水后会持续反胃几分钟。</li><li>雾气轻度遮蔽了巢穴附近6里内的所有陆地。</li></ul><br>龙死亡后，以上植被将得以保留如同其是自然生长而来，但其它效应会在1d10日内逐渐衰退消散。<br><br><h2>特性</h2><strong>水陆两栖

A respected knight of the Order of the Crown, Sarlamir received a divine quest from the god Paladine years before the Cataclysm. Paladine told him the Kingpriest of Istar had created a magical wonder in the east—a flying city—and in so doing, the kingpriest had enraged the metallic dragons that had long remained hidden on Krynn. Paladine tasked Sarlamir with going to this flying city, assuaging the dragons’ fury, and convincing the kingpriest to return the city to the land. Sarlamir agreed. The knight knew his task was daunting, though, and decided to hedge his bets. He took his family’s greatest treasure with him: an ancient <i>dragonlance</i>.</p><p>Sarlamir and his fellow knights reached the kingpriest’s flying city and stood before a flight of righteously furious metallic dragons. When the kingpriest refused to land the flying city, the dragons refused to leave. As the conflict escalated, Sarlamir used his <i>dragonlance</i> to slay the dragons’ leader, the gold dragon Karavarix. As soon as Karavarix’s blood touched the <i>dragonlance</i>, the weapon rusted away in Knight Sarlamir’s hand. The dragons attacked, slaying Sarlamir and crashing the flying city.</p><p>A handful of Sarlamir’s loyal knights escaped, and they brought his body and his cursed <i>dragonlance</i> back to Kalaman.

Those who become skeletal knights were typically virtuous in life but betrayed their oaths and died in disgrace. Unable to rest, they are now unswervingly loyal to the villains they serve.

Ever.”</em><br> —Riddlefiddle the Satyr, on ogres </blockquote><p></p><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26120323/BWCjkhoEtzbpyYrbq-kcjA/med.png?1481326629\"></div><h2>Ogres</h2> Ogres are as lazy of mind as they are strong of body. They live by raiding, scavenging, and killing for food and pleasure. The average adult specimen stands between 9 and 10 feet tall and weighs close to a thousand pounds.<br><br> <strong><em>Furious Tempers.</em></strong> Ogres are notorious for their quick tempers, which flare at the smallest perceived offense. Insults and name-calling can rouse an ogre’s wrath in an instant—as can stealing from it, bumping, jabbing, or prodding it, laughing, making faces, or simply looking at it the wrong way. When its rage is incited, an ogre lashes out in a frustrated tantrum until it runs out of objects or creatures to smash.<br><br> <strong><em>Gruesome Gluttons.</em></strong> Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw. If enough of its victim remains after the ogre?has gorged itself, it might make a loincloth from its quarry’s skin and a necklace from its leftover bones. This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.<br><br> <strong><em>Greedy Collectors.</em></strong> An ogre’s eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous “treasure” taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig. Ogres also delight in the gleam of gold and silver, and they will fight one another over small handfuls of coins. Smarter creatures can earn an ogre’s trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.<br><br> <strong><em>Legendary Stupidity.</em></strong> Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words. Ogres believe what they are told and are easy to fool or confuse, but they break things they don’t understand. Silver-tongued tricksters who test their talents on these savages typically end up eating their eloquent words—and then being eaten in turn.<br><br> <strong><em>Primitive Wanderers.</em></strong> Ogres clothe themselves in animal pelts and uproot trees for use as crude tools and weapons. They create stone-tipped javelins for hunting. When they establish lairs, they settle near the rural edges of civilized lands, taking advantage of poorly protected livestock, undefended larders, and unwary farmers.<br><br> An ogre sleeps in caves, animal dens, or under trees until it finds a cabin or isolated farmhouse, whereupon it kills the inhabitants and lairs there. Whenever it is bored or hungry, an ogre ventures out from its lair, attacking anything that crosses its path. Only after an ogre has depleted an area of food does it move on.<br><br> <strong><em>Ogre Gangs.</em></strong> Ogres sometimes band together in small, nomadic groups, but they lack a true sense of tribalism. When bands of ogres meet, one might attempt to capture the members of the other group to increase its numbers. However, ogre bands are just as likely to trade members freely, especially if the welcoming band is temporarily flush with food and weapons.<br><br> Whenever possible, ogres gang up with other monsters to bully or prey on creatures weaker than themselves. They associate freely with goblinoids, orcs, and trolls, and practically worship giants. In the giants’ complex social structure (known as the ordning), ogres rank beneath the lowest giants in status. As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.<br><br> <h2>Half-Ogre</h2> When an ogre mates with a human, hobgoblin, bugbear, or orc, the result is always a half-ogre. (Ogres don’t mate with dwarves, halflings, or elves. They eat them.) Human mothers rarely survive the birth of a half-ogre offspring.<br><br> The half-ogre offspring of an ogre and an orc is also called an ogrillon. An adult half-ogre or ogrillon stands 8 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds on average.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Battleaxe (One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Battleaxe (Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 14 (2d10 + 3) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.<br><br> <strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.<p></p><p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NzViM2MwOTEwZmNj]{Betrayal at High Hill}: (Gragonis)</li></ul></section>"

A golem has no ambitions, needs no sustenance, feels no pain, and knows no remorse. An unstoppable juggernaut, it exists to follow its creator’s orders, and it protects or attacks as that creator demands.<br><br> To create a golem, one requires a <em>manual of golems</em> (see the <em>Dungeon Master’s Guide</em>). The comprehensive illustrations and instructions in a manual detail the process for creating a golem of a particular type.<br><br><strong><em> Elemental Spirit in Material Form.</em></strong> The construction of a golem begins with the building of its body, requiring great command of the craft of sculpting, stonecutting, ironworking, or surgery. Sometimes a golem’s creator is the master of the art, but often the individual who desires a golem must enlist master artisans to do the work.<br><br> After constructing the body from clay, flesh, iron, or stone, the golem’s creator infuses it with a spirit from the Elemental Plane of Earth. This tiny spark of life has no memory, personality, or history. It is simply the impetus to move and obey. This process binds the spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the golem’s creator.<br><br><strong><em> Ageless Guardians.</em></strong> Golems can guard sacred sites, tombs, and treasure vaults long after the deaths of their creators, carrying out their appointed tasks for all eternity while brushing off physical damage and ignoring all but the most potent spells.<br><br> A golems can be created with a special amulet or other item that allows the possessor of the item to control the golem. Golems whose creators are long dead can thus be harnessed to serve a new master.<br><br><strong><em> Blind Obedience.</em></strong> When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is incapacitated, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can’t fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently—or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.<br><br> A golem can’t think or act for itself. Though it understands its commands perfectly, it has no grasp of language beyond that understanding, and can’t be reasoned with or tricked with words.<br><br><strong><em> Constructed Nature.</em></strong> A golem doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Stone Golem</h2> Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts.<br><br> Like other golems, stone golems are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Immutable Form</strong>: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.<br><br><strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br><strong>Magic Weapons</strong>: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The golem makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Slow (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 ft. of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br> <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NTRhOTNkYWE2NjM4]{Path of Memories}: M2</li></ul></section>"

Acquire it, and the slaad is yours to command.</em></blockquote> <div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26546288/9hLL2G4YNan72_vyBZsesw/med.png?1482357199\"></div><h2>Slaadi</h2> In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest and meadow, ruined castles, and isolated islands drift through a tumult of fire, water, earth, and wind. The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.<br><br> <strong><em>The Spawning Stone.</em></strong> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone’s power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus’s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus’s massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.<br><br> The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn’t perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.<br><br> <strong><em>Birth and Transformation.</em></strong> Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.<br><br> <strong><em>Shapechangers.</em></strong> Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.<br><br> <h2> Red Slaad</h2> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/302651038/Cmz-RfQ_mLXFcGjYdTe5-Q/original.png\">When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way out of the host’s body, feeds on the host’s remains, and then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole transforms into a fully grown blue slaad — or green slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or higher — within 2d12 hours. <br><br> <h2>Variant: Slaad Control Gems</h2> As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad’s brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child’s fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad’s gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad’s gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.<br><br> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26545544/VGTI7rbFkH6SP4BxURj9aQ/med.png?1482355708\" alt=\"\">A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.<br><br> <strong>Control Gem</strong>: Implanted in the slaad’s brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.<br><br> Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against <em>imprisonment</em>, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster’s open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A <em>wish</em> spell, if cast in the slaad’s presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.<br><br> A <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.<br><br> Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br> <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br> <strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (2d4 + 3) piercing damage.<br><br> <strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be infected with a disease — a minuscule slaad egg.<br><br>A humanoid host can carry only one slaad egg to term at a time. Over three months, the egg moves to the chest cavity, gestates, and forms a slaad tadpole. In the 24-hour period before giving birth, the host starts to feel unwell, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. At birth, the tadpole chews its way through vital organs and out of the host’s chest in 1 round, killing the host in the process.<br><br>If the disease is cured before the tadpole’s emergence, the unborn slaad is disintegrated. <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MmViNGY3NmM2NDBi]{D: Sunward Fortress}: D5</li></ul></section>"

Having been awoken from its rest, it punishes transgressors with the power of its unholy curse.<br><br> <strong><em>Preserved Wrath.</em></strong> The long burial rituals that accompany a mummy’s entombment help protect its body from rot. In the embalming process, the newly dead creature’s organs are removed and placed in special jars, and its corpse is treated with preserving oils, herbs, and wrappings. After the body has been prepared, the corpse is typically wrapped in linen bandages.<br><br> <strong><em>The Will of Dark Gods.</em></strong> An undead mummy is created when the priest of a death god or other dark deity ritually imbues a prepared corpse with necromantic magic. The mummy’s linen wrappings are inscribed with necromantic markings before the burial ritual concludes with an invocation to darkness. As a mummy endures in undeath, it animates in response to conditions specified by the ritual. Most commonly, a transgression against its tomb, treasures, lands, or former loved ones will cause a mummy to rise.<br><br> <strong><em>The Punished.</em></strong> Once deceased, an individual has no say in whether or not its body is made into a mummy. Some mummies were powerful individuals who displeased a high priest or pharaoh, or who committed crimes of treason, adultery, or murder. As punishment, they were cursed with eternal undeath, embalmed, mummified, and sealed away. Other times, mummies acting as tomb guardians are created from slaves put to death specifically to serve a greater purpose.<br><br> <strong><em>Creature of Ritual.</em></strong> A mummy obeys the conditions and parameters laid down by the rituals that created it, driven only to punish transgressors. The overwhelming terror that foreshadows a mummy’s attack can leave the intended victim paralyzed with fright. In the days following a mummy’s touch, a victim’s body rots from the outside in, until nothing but dust remains.<br><br> <strong><em>Ending a Mummy’s Curse.</em></strong> Rare magic can undo or dispel the ritual that gave rise to a mummy, allowing it to truly die. More commonly, a mummy can be sent back to its endless rest by undoing the transgression that caused it to rise. A sacred idol might be replaced in its niche, a stolen treasure could be returned to its tomb, or a temple might be purified of despoiling bloodshed.<br><br> More ephemeral or permanent offenses, such as revealing a secret the mummy wished kept or killing an individual the mummy loved, can’t be so easily remedied. In such cases, a mummy might slaughter all the creatures responsible and still not sate its wrath.<br><br> <strong><em>Undead Archives.</em></strong> Though they seldom bother to do so, mummies can speak. As a result, some serve as undead repositories of lost lore, and can be consulted by the descendants of those who created them. Powerful individuals sometimes intentionally sequester mummies away for occasional consultation.<br><br> <strong><em>Undead Nature.</em></strong> A mummy doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.<br><br> <strong>Rotting Fist</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10, 3d6, for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.<br><br> <strong>Dreadful Glare</strong>: The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 ft. of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies, but not mummy lords, for the next 24 hours.<br><br><p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YTg1MGE4MzE3YzE5]{Temple of Paladine}: P4</li></ul></section>"

Only a few can be found on the Material Plane. The rest reside on the Elemental Planes, where they rule from lavish palaces and are attended by worshipful slaves.<br><br>Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.<br><br><strong><em>Creatures of the Elements.</em></strong> A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.<br><br>A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie’s form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don’t mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.<br><br>When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.<br><br><strong><em>Rule or Be Ruled.</em></strong> Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie’s power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie’s ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.<br><br>In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.<br><br><strong><em>Decadent Nobility.</em></strong> Noble genies are the rarest of their kind. They are used to getting what they want, and have learned to trade their ability to grant wishes to attain the objects of their desire. This constant indulgence has made them decadent, while their supreme power over reality makes them haughty and arrogant. Their vast palaces overflow with wonders and sensory delights beyond imagination.<br><br>Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim. A genie isn’t beholden to any noble genie, however, and will sometimes choose to defy a noble genie’s will and risk the consequences.<br><br><strong><em>The Power of Worship.</em></strong> Genies acknowledge the gods as powerful entities but have no desire to court or worship them. They find the endless fawning and mewling of religious devotees tiresome—except as it is directed toward them by their worshipful slaves.<br><br>Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms—even whole continents or worlds—bow down before them.<br><br><h2>Variant: Genie Powers</h2>Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their appearance or the nature of reality.<br><br><strong><em>Disguises.</em></strong> Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast the <em>disguise self</em> spell at will, often with a longer duration than is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the <em>true polymorph</em> spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape, but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as well.<br><br><strong><em>Wishes.</em></strong> The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn’t a genie. Once a genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can’t grant wishes again for some amount of time (usually 1 year), and cosmic law dictates that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific creature only once in that creature’s existence.<br><br>To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the <em>wish</em> spell on the creature’s behalf to bring about the effect. Depending on the genie’s nature, the genie might try to pervert the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish’s poor wording. The perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie’s benefit.<br><br><h2>Marid</h2>Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the ground-hugging dao, and the fuming efreet.<br><br>Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy water.<br><br><strong><em>Water Lords.</em></strong> Water is a marid’s native element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a weapon to bludgeon its foes.<br><br><strong><em>Marid Homes.</em></strong> Marids are rare on the Material Plane. They inhabit mighty and majestic coral fortresses located in the Elemental Plane of Water. These citadels float in the depths of the plane and contain opulent, air-filled chambers where slaves and guests reside.<br><br>A marid doesn’t expect much from its slaves, simply wanting to have them for the status of ownership. Marids go out of their way to obtain skilled slaves, and aren’t above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or storytellers for use in their courts.<br><br><strong><em>Egotistical Hierarchs.</em></strong> All marids claim a title of nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on the part of the self-important marids.<br><br>Marids treat all others—including other genies—as inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet.<br><br>Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a creature that knows its place.<br><br><strong><em>Whimsical Storytellers.</em></strong> Marids are champion tale-tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren’t always malicious in their deception, but embellishments suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Amphibious</strong>: The marid can breathe air and water.<br><br><strong>Elemental Demise</strong>: If the marid dies, its body disintegrates into a burst of water and foam, leaving behind only equipment the marid was wearing or carrying.<br><br><strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The marid’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br>• At will: <em>create or destroy water</em>, <em>detect evil and good</em>, <em>detect magic</em>, <em>fog cloud</em>, <em>purify food and drink</em><br>• 3/day each: <em>tongues</em>, <em>water breathing</em>, <em>water walk</em><br>• 1/day each: <em>conjure elemental</em> (water elemental only), <em>control water</em>, <em>gaseous form</em>, <em>invisibility</em>, <em>plane shift</em><br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The marid makes two trident attacks.<br><br><strong>Trident (Melee; One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Trident (Melee; Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. , one target. <em>Hit</em>: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Trident (Ranged)</strong>:<em> Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Water Jet</strong>: The marid magically shoots water in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and, if it is Huge or smaller, is pushed up to 20 feet away from the marid and knocked prone. On a success, a target takes half the bludgeoning damage, but is neither pushed nor knocked prone.<br> <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YTg1MGE4MzE3YzE5]{Temple of Paladine}: P3 (Jamir)</li></ul></section>"

You can choose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one. Flood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored. Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex.</p>"

Alstare Bellis caught her and turned her into a vampire. Fifty years later he bricked her up in the Flying Citadel, though she has no idea why (it's because she's a chatterbox). </p><hr><p><br></p><blockquote><em>\"I am The Ancient, I am The Land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears down stone into sand.\"</em><br>—Count Strahd von Zarovich </blockquote><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26895748/qZLuNJPplpSZ2_zMQ0YsQA/med.png?1483389477\"></div><h2>Vampires</h2> Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.<br><br><strong><em> Dark Desires.</em></strong> Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.<br><br><strong><em> Born from Death.</em></strong> Most of a vampire’s victims become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire’s hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master’s control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.<br><br><strong><em> Chained to the Grave.</em></strong> Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn’t receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.<br><br> <h2>Player Characters as Vampires</h2> The game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don’t change, except that the character’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren’t higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire’s damage resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire’s attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire’s proficiency bonus + the vampire’s Charisma modifier. The character’s alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.<br><br> <h2>Variants: Vampire Warriors and Spellcasters</h2> Some vampires have martial training and battlefield experience. Their entry can be found <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vampire Warrior\">here</a>.<br><br> Some vampires are practitioners of the arcane arts. Their entry can be found <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vampire Spellcaster\">here</a>.<br><br> <h2>A Vampire’s Lair</h2> A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.<br><br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region surrounding a vampire’s lair is warped by the creature’s unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:<br><br> • There’s a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.<br> • Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.<br> • Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.<br> • A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire’s lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.<br><br> If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26896527/zJIHO4pECtYk1ck-5xpKyA/med.png?1483390855\"></div><br><br> <h3>Strahd von Zarovich</h3> <div>A brilliant thinker and capable warrior in life, Strahd von Zarovich fought in countless battles for his people. When war and killing finally stripped him of his youth and strength, he settled in the remote valley of Barovia and built a castle on a towering pinnacle, from which he could survey his lands. His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd’s adviser and constant companion.<br><br> In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd’s beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.<br><br> In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana’s heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft’s walls. Strahd’s guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire—the first vampire, according to many sages.<br><br> In the centuries since his transformation, Strahd’s lust for life and youth have only grown. He broods in his dark castle, cursing the living for stealing away what he lost, and never admitting his hand in the tragedy he created.</div><br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Shapechanger</strong>: If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.<br><br> While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br> While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.<br><br> <strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br> <strong>Misty Escape</strong>: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.<br><br> While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.<br><br> <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.<br><br> <strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br> <strong>Vampire Weaknesses</strong>: The vampire has the following flaws: <br><br> • <em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.<br> • <em>Harmed by Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.<br> • <em>Stake to the Heart.</em> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br> • <em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.<br><br> <strong>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target, escape DC 18.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.<br><br> <strong>Charm</strong>: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack. <br>Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.<br><br> <strong>Children of the Night (1/Day)</strong>: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.<br><br> <h2>Legendary Actions</h2> Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below.它每次只可选择执行一个传奇动作项，且必须在另一生物回合结束时执行。龙在其回合开始时恢复所有消耗的传奇动作数。<br><br> <strong>Move</strong>: The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br> <strong>Unarmed Strike</strong>: The vampire makes one unarmed strike.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The vampire makes one bite attack. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S11</li></ul></section>"

My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. I was the warrior, I was good and just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a just god, but the war years and the killing years wore down my soul as the wind wears down stone into sand.\"</em><br>—Count Strahd von Zarovich </blockquote><p></p><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26895748/qZLuNJPplpSZ2_zMQ0YsQA/med.png?1483389477\"></div><h2>Vampires</h2> Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and sate that hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them. They never cast shadows or reflections, and any vampire wishing to move unnoticed among the living keeps to the darkness and far from reflective surfaces.<br><br><strong><em> Dark Desires.</em></strong> Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.<br><br><strong><em> Born from Death.</em></strong> Most of a vampire’s victims become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire’s hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them. If a true vampire allows a spawn to draw blood from its own body, the spawn transforms into a true vampire no longer under its master’s control. Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.<br><br><strong><em> Chained to the Grave.</em></strong> Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn’t receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> Neither a vampire nor a vampire spawn requires air.<br><br> <h2>Player Characters as Vampires</h2> The game statistics of a player character transformed into a vampire spawn and then a vampire don’t change, except that the character’s Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren’t higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire’s damage resistances, darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire’s attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire’s proficiency bonus + the vampire’s Charisma modifier. The character’s alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a wish spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.<br><br> <h2>Variants: Vampire Warriors and Spellcasters</h2> Some vampires have martial training and battlefield experience. Their entry can be found <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vampire Warrior\">here</a>.<br><br> Some vampires are practitioners of the arcane arts. Their entry can be found <a href=\"https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Vampire Spellcaster\">here</a>.<br><br> <h2>A Vampire’s Lair</h2> A vampire chooses a grand yet defensible location for its lair, such as a castle, fortified manor, or walled abbey. It hides its coffin in an underground crypt or vault guarded by vampire spawn or other loyal creatures of the night.<br><br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region surrounding a vampire’s lair is warped by the creature’s unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:<br><br> • There’s a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.<br> • Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.<br> • Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.<br> • A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire’s lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.<br><br> If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after 2d6 days. <br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26896527/zJIHO4pECtYk1ck-5xpKyA/med.png?1483390855\"></div><br><br> <h3>Strahd von Zarovich</h3> <div>A brilliant thinker and capable warrior in life, Strahd von Zarovich fought in countless battles for his people. When war and killing finally stripped him of his youth and strength, he settled in the remote valley of Barovia and built a castle on a towering pinnacle, from which he could survey his lands. His brother Sergei came to live with him in Castle Ravenloft, becoming Strahd’s adviser and constant companion.<br><br> In his brother, Strahd saw everything he had lost. Sergei was handsome and young, while Strahd had become old and scarred. Resentment colored their relationship, eventually turning into hatred. Strahd’s beloved, Tatyana, spurned him for Sergei, whom she pledged to marry.<br><br> In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana’s heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft’s walls. Strahd’s guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire—the first vampire, according to many sages.<br><br> In the centuries since his transformation, Strahd’s lust for life and youth have only grown. He broods in his dark castle, cursing the living for stealing away what he lost, and never admitting his hand in the tragedy he created.</div><br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Shapechanger</strong>: If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.<br><br> While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br> While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight.<br><br> <strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day)</strong>: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br><br> <strong>Misty Escape</strong>: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.<br><br> While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.<br><br> <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.<br><br> <strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br> <strong>Vampire Weaknesses</strong>: The vampire has the following flaws: <br><br> • <em>Forbiddance.</em> The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.<br> • <em>Harmed by Running Water.</em> The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.<br> • <em>Stake to the Heart.</em> If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.<br> • <em>Sunlight Hypersensitivity.</em> The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.<br><br> <strong>Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target, escape DC 18.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.<br><br> <strong>Charm</strong>: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bit attack. <br>Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect.<br><br> <strong>Children of the Night (1/Day)</strong>: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.<br><br> <h2>Legendary Actions</h2> Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below.它每次只可选择执行一个传奇动作项，且必须在另一生物回合结束时执行。龙在其回合开始时恢复所有消耗的传奇动作数。<br><br> <strong>Move</strong>: The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.<br><br> <strong>Unarmed Strike</strong>: The vampire makes one unarmed strike.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Costs 2 Actions)</strong>: The vampire makes one bite attack.<p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S9 (Alstare Bellis)</li></ul></section>"

When death stills such a creature’s heart and snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda.<br><br> Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction.<br><br><strong><em> Life Eaters.</em></strong> Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things. When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight’s cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.<br><br><strong><em> Shadow of the Grave.</em></strong> Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places, surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and avoided by bird and beast.<br><br> Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A wight doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Sunlight Sensitivity</strong>: While in sunlight, the wight has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The wight makes two longsword attacks or two longbow attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.<br><br> <strong>Life Drain</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.<br><br> A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a zombie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.<br><br> <strong>Longsword (One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Longsword (Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage.<br><br> <strong>Longbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S3</li></ul></section>"

That should have been our first clue.”</em><br> —from the journal of Jaster Hollowquill, on his first exploration of Undermountain </blockquote><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26269621/Ji1rktPqVpoh-TRgLbPh4w/med.png?1481662589\"></div><h2>Oozes</h2> Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks. The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze’s presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch.<br><br> Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.<br><br> <strong><em>Slow Death.</em></strong> An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim’s comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.<br><br> Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.<br><br> <strong><em>Unwitting Servants.</em></strong> Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze’s need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.<br><br> <strong><em>Spawn of Juiblex.</em></strong> According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex. Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.<br><br> <strong><em>Ooze Nature.</em></strong> An ooze doesn’t require sleep.<br><br> <h2>Black Pudding</h2> A black pudding resembles a heaving mound of sticky black sludge. In dim passageways, the pudding appears to be little more than a blot of shadow.<br><br> Flesh, wood, metal, and bone dissolve when the pudding ebbs over them. Stone remains behind, wiped clean.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Amorphous</strong>: The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br><br> <strong>Corrosive Form</strong>: A creature that touches the pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage.<br><br> The pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.<br><br> <strong>Spider Climb</strong>: The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Pseudopod</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.<br><br> <h2>Reactions</h2> <strong>Split</strong>: When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to half the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller than the original pudding. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YjQwNjM3YjAyMWRh]{C: Blue Phoenix Shrine}: C6</li><li>@JournalEntry[MzcxMjFmM2RmMGI3]{Flying Citadel Sublevels Locations}: S3</li></ul></section>"

They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.<br><br> The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.<br><br>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.<br><br><strong><em> Mountain Masters.</em></strong> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.<br><br><strong><em> Arrogant Tyrants.</em></strong> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.<br><br> No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.<br><strong><em><br> Status and Slaves.</em></strong> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.<br><br> When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn’t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe’s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.<br><br><strong><em> Obsessive Collectors.</em></strong> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.<br><br> A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item’s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can’t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.<br><br> <h2>A Red Dragon’s Lair</h2> Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.<br><br>With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls—and the wider world it seeks to control.<br><br> Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered. <br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul><li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li><li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li></ul> <br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul><li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.</li><li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li><li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li></ul> <br> If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NTk0NTlkYjgzNjY3]{Dragon Army Rout}</li></ul></section>"

Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.<br><br><strong><em> Goblinoids.</em></strong> Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.<br><br><strong><em> Martial Might.</em></strong> A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.<br><br> Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.<br><br><strong><em> Military Legions.</em></strong> Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br><br> As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em> Strategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br><br> Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br><br><strong><em> Beast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br><br><strong><em> Conquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br><br> Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.<br><br> Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.<br><br><strong><em> Legion of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.<br><br> </p><div><img src=\"https://imgsrv.roll20.net/?src=https%3A//s3.amazonaws.com/files.staging.d20.io/images/89156415/4ZZJNAwIBwQBC716CjTNCA/original.png\"><br></div><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Martial Advantage</strong>: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Longsword (One-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d8 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longsword (Two-Handed)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 6 (1d10 + 1) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Longbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +3 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target.

A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br><br>As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em>Strategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br><br>Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br><br><strong><em>Beast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br><br><strong><em>Conquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br><br>Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes. When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.<br><br>Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.<br><br><strong><em>Legion of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids. As terrifying as this figure is, hobgoblins don’t fear death, believing that when they die in battle, their spirits join the honored ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26498292/ZD9YoSsb5a4SVoTW61N_1A/med.jpg?1482250480\"></div><br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Martial Advantage</strong>: Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn’t incapacitated.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.<br><br><strong>Greatsword</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Melee)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Javelin (Ranged)</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target.

Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling around stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets the nearest prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.<br><br><strong><em> Roving Ambushers.</em></strong> Gricks remain in an area until the food supply dwindles, often because sentient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes around their lairs. When prey is scarce in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges. A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.<br><br><strong><em> Spoils of Slaughter.</em></strong> Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs.

They remember flashes and echoes, and sometimes things or creatures they encounter painfully remind them of what they once had. These fleeting moments of lucidity quickly burn away in rage and anguish, driving the dragons to destroy the would-be memento.<br></p><h2>Death Dragons</h2><p>Death dragons are the Undead skeletal remains of metallic or chromatic dragons, infused with the lingering fires of the Cataclysm by foul magic. Rarely, death dragons arise when a dragon meets its end in a way that torments its soul and consumes it with a need for vengeance. Regardless of how it arose, a death dragon retains a shadow of its former personality. The stronger the death dragon, the more it fights the hate consuming it, holding on to some vestige of its memories.</p><p>A death dragon’s bones burn with violet Cataclysmic fire, which it can unleash in a horrific mockery of the breath weapon it possessed in life. The breath snuffs out life force and infuses undeath into corpses it touches.

They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.<br><br><strong><em> Animated Dead.</em></strong> Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.<br><br> While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.<br><br><strong><em> Obedient Servants.</em></strong> Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can’t read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.<br><br> A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.<br><br> Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren’t mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn’t work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.<br><br><strong><em> Habitual Behaviors.</em></strong> Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master’s control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can’t eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.<br><br> When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A skeleton doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Hooves</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.<em>伤害：</em>11（2d6+4）点钝击伤害。 <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YWFiZWM5YTE1Yjdl]{Raided Catacombs}: R4 (Xheriev, Steelwind)</li></ul></section>"

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>"

If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults the table.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane. Mishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).</p>"

Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.<br><br><strong><em>Goblinoids.</em></strong> Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.<br><br><strong><em>Martial Might.</em></strong> A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.<br><br>Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.<br><br><strong><em>Military Legions.</em></strong> Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.<br><br>As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren’t restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.<br><br><strong><em>Strategic Thinkers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a strong grasp of tactics and discipline, and can carry out sophisticated battle plans under the direction of a strategically minded leader. However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.<br><br>Legions often supplement their ranks with less reliable and more expendable troops, including goblins, bugbears, orcs, evil humans, ogres, and giants.<br><br><strong><em>Beast Trainers.</em></strong> Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.<br><br><strong><em>Conquer and Control.</em></strong> Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.<br><br>Hobgoblin warlords never tire of combat, but they don’t take up arms lightly. Before they attack, hobgoblins conduct thorough reconnaissance to gauge the strengths and weaknesses of their foes.

It might seek to avenge its own death, fulfill an oath, or relay a message to a loved one. A ghost might not realize that it has died and continue the everyday routine of its life. Others are driven by wickedness or spite, as with a ghost that refuses to rest until every member of a certain family or organization is dead.<br><br> The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life. The ghost of a person tortured to death might be killed again by the implements of that torture. The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.<br><br><strong><em> Ghostly Manifestations.</em></strong> Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere. Cold spots settle in rooms that have roaring fires. A choking stench might seep into the area, inanimate objects might move of their own accord, and corpses might rise from the grave. The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.<br><br><strong><em> Undead Nature.</em></strong> A ghost doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Ethereal Sight</strong>: The ghost can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.<br><br><strong>Incorporeal Movement</strong>: The ghost can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Withering Touch</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.<br><br><strong>Etherealness</strong>: The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.<br><br><strong>Horrifying Visage</strong>: Each non-undead creature within 60 ft. of the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x 10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a <em>greater restoration</em> spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.<br><br><strong>Possession (Recharge 6)</strong>: One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.<br><br>The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[ZDU3MDQ4Mzg0OTkx]{E: Wakenreth}: E3 (Jentida), E5 (Veriel)</li><li>@JournalEntry[NDgyMDQ5YjI2NDM0]{Exploring the City}</li></ul></section>"

They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures.<br><br> The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.<br><br>The scales of a red dragon wyrmling are a bright glossy scarlet, turning a dull, deeper red and becoming as thick and strong as metal as the dragon ages. Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.<br><br><strong><em> Mountain Masters.</em></strong> Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.<br><br><strong><em> Arrogant Tyrants.</em></strong> Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.<br><br> No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.<br><strong><em><br> Status and Slaves.</em></strong> Red dragons are fiercely territorial and isolationist. However, they yearn to know about events in the wider world, and they make use of lesser creatures as informants, messengers, and spies. They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.<br><br> When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn’t forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe’s leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.<br><br><strong><em> Obsessive Collectors.</em></strong> Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance. A red dragon has a special affection for treasure claimed from powerful enemies it has slain, exhibiting that treasure to prove its superiority.<br><br> A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item’s exact location. It might notice the absence of a single coin, igniting its rage as it tracks down and slays the thief without mercy. If the thief can’t be found, the dragon goes on a rampage, laying waste to towns and villages in an attempt to sate its wrath.<br><br> <h2>A Red Dragon’s Lair</h2> Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps.<br><br>With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls—and the wider world it seeks to control.<br><br> Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon’s power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered. <br><br><h3>Lair Actions</h3> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:<br><br><ul><li>Magma erupts from a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geyser’s area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</li><li>A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around the dragon. Each creature other than the dragon on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li><li>Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.</li></ul> <br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region containing a legendary red dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:<br><br><ul><li>Small earthquakes are common within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.</li><li>Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted by sulfur.</li><li>Rocky fissures within 1 mile of the dragon’s lair form portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing creatures of elemental fire into the world to dwell nearby.</li></ul> <br> If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.<br><br><strong>Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC l3 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NzlhNTg2ZDVlY2U2]{Battle of Kalaman}</li></ul></section>"

Isolationists by nature, they avoid contact with other races and try to drive away strangers in their territory.<br><br><strong><em>Nonreligious.</em></strong> Legends claim that the cyclopes are the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these creatures pay little heed to any deities. They see little benefit in prayer and dislike ritual, which they perceive as complex and foreign. However, a cyclops that gains direct benefit from some site of divine power, or which is threatened by a supernatural force or creature, will pay homage as long as the benefit or threat remains.<br><br><strong><em>Unsophisticated.</em></strong> Though they are reasonably intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone or in small family groups, lairing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry stone construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.<br><br>A cyclops lairs within a day’s journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other.<br><br>Cyclopes don’t use money for trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal. <br><br><strong><em>Unwise.</em></strong> Cyclopes aren’t great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often be tricked by clever foes.<br><br>Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure. However, their sense of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirsty violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a “god” is a mere mortal.<br><br><h2>Traits</h2><strong>Poor Depth Perception</strong>: The cyclops has disadvantage on any attack roll against a target more than 30 feet away.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The cyclops makes two greatclub attacks.<br><br><strong>Greatclub</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Rock</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +9 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NDgyMDQ5YjI2NDM0]{Exploring the City}</li></ul></section>"

Individually weak, goblins gather in large—sometimes overwhelming—numbers. They crave power and regularly abuse whatever authority they obtain.<br><br><strong><em> Goblinoids.</em></strong> Goblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. Their larger cousins, hobgoblins and bugbears, like to bully goblins into submission. Goblins are lazy and undisciplined, making them poor servants, laborers, and guards.<br><br><strong><em> Malicious Glee.</em></strong> Motivated by greed and malice, goblins can’t help but celebrate the few times they have the upper hand. They dance, caper with sheer joy when victory is theirs. Once their revels have ended, goblins delight in the torment of other creatures and embrace all manner of wickedness.<br><br><strong><em> Leaders and Followers.</em></strong> Goblins are ruled by the strongest or smartest among them. A goblin boss might command a single lair, while a goblin king or queen (who is nothing more than a glorified goblin boss) rules hundreds of goblins, spread out among multiple lairs to ensure the tribe’s survival. Goblin bosses are easily ousted, and many goblin tribes are taken over by hobgoblin warlords or bugbear chiefs.<br><br><strong><em> Challenging Lairs.</em></strong> Goblins festoon their lairs with alarms designed to signal the arrival of intruders. Those lairs are also riddled with narrow tunnels and bolt-holes that human-sized creatures can’t navigate, but which goblins can crawl through with ease, allowing them to flee or to circle around and surprise their enemies.<br><br><strong><em> Rat Keepers and Wolf Riders.</em></strong> Goblins have an affinity for rats and wolves, raising them to serve as companions and mounts, respectively. Like rats, goblins shun sunlight and sleep underground during the day. Like wolves, they are pack hunters, made bolder by their numbers. When they hunt from the backs of wolves, goblins use hit-and-run attacks.<br><br><strong><em> Worshipers of Maglubiyet.</em></strong> Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet’s army on the plane of Acheron. This is a “privilege” that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One’s eternal tyranny even more than death. <br><br><blockquote><em>\"Bree-Yark!\"</em><br> —Goblin for “We surrender!” (or so they say)</blockquote><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Nimble Escape</strong>: The goblin can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of its turns.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Scimitar</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Shortbow</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack</em>: +4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.<br> <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[ZGJkMmIzNDI1YjI3]{The First Mission}</li></ul></section>"

Acquire it, and the slaad is yours to command.</em></blockquote><br> <div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26556386/7bXBW04LDGTrvMF8z7uarw/med.png?1482376556\"></div><h2>Slaadi</h2> In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest and meadow, ruined castles, and isolated islands drift through a tumult of fire, water, earth, and wind. The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.<br><br> <strong><em>The Spawning Stone.</em></strong> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone’s power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus’s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus’s massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.<br><br> The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn’t perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.<br><br> <strong><em>Birth and Transformation.</em></strong> Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.<br><br> <strong><em>Shapechangers.</em></strong> Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.<br><br> <h2>Death Slaad</h2> Death slaadi are suffused with energy from the Negative Energy Plane and exemplify evil’s corruption of chaos, and they take sadistic pleasure in bringing harm to others. They propagate their race by dragooning mobs of red and blue slaadi and invading other planes. Humanoids who survive the incursion become incubators for new slaadi.<br><br> <h2>Variant: Slaad Control Gems</h2> As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad’s brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child’s fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad’s gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad’s gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.<br><br> <img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26545544/VGTI7rbFkH6SP4BxURj9aQ/med.png?1482355708\" alt=\"\">A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.<br><br> <strong>Control Gem</strong>: Implanted in the slaad’s brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being charmed while so controlled.<br><br> Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against <em>imprisonment</em>, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster’s open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A <em>wish</em> spell, if cast in the slaad’s presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.<br><br> A <em>greater restoration</em> spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.<br><br> Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an incapacitated slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (4d10) psychic damage to the slaad.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Shapechanger</strong>: The slaad can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.<br><br> <strong>Innate Spellcasting</strong>: The slaad’s innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The slaad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br><br> • At will: <em>detect magic, detect thoughts, invisibility </em>(self only)<em>, mage hand, major image</em><br> • 2/day each: <em>fear, fireball, fly, tongues</em><br> • 1/day each: <em>cloudkill, plane shift</em><br><br> <strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br> <strong>Regeneration</strong>: The slaad regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The slaad makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or greatsword.<br><br> <strong>Bite (Slaad Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.<br><br> <strong>Claws (Slaad Form Only)</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.<br><br> <strong>Greatsword</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[NDgyMDQ5YjI2NDM0]{Exploring the City}</li></ul></section>"

If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected. You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends. Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any language. Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>"

You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench). As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><strong>Higher Level.</strong>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your Concentration.</p>"

Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon’s treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon’s hoard.<br><br> A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature’s need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon’s point of view. A metallic dragon must be bribed or otherwise convinced to part with the item.<br><br><strong><em> Solitary Shapeshifters.</em></strong> At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.<br><br> Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.<br><br><strong><em> The Persistence of Memory.</em></strong> Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon’s hoard three centuries before.<br><br><strong><em> King of Good Dragons.</em></strong> The chief deity of the metallic dragons is Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon. He dwells in the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia, but often wanders the Material Plane in the magical guise of a venerable human male in peasant robes. In this form, he is usually accompanied by seven golden canaries—actually seven ancient gold dragons in polymorphed form.<br><br> Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood. Good-aligned clerics and paladins sometimes worship Bahamut for his dedication to justice and protection. As a lesser god, he has the power to grant divine spells.<br><br> <h2>Silver Dragon</h2> The friendliest and most social of the metallic dragons, silver dragons cheerfully assist good creatures in need.<br><br> A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling’s scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.<br><br><strong><em> Dragons of Virtue.</em></strong> Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one’s actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don’t take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.<br><br><strong><em> Friends of the Small Races.</em></strong> Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.<br><br> Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.<br><br><strong><em> Respect for Humanity.</em></strong> Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don’t. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.<br><br><strong><em> Hoarding History.</em></strong> Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelry crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.<br><br> <h2>A Silver Dragon’s Lair</h2> Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.<br><br> <h3>Lair Actions</h3> On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:<br><br><ul><li>The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the <em>fog cloud</em> spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.</li><li>A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (1d10) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.</li></ul> <br> <h3>Regional Effects</h3> The region containing a legendary silver dragon’s lair is warped by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.<br><br><ul><li>Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn’t need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the control weather spell.</li><li>Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon’s or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.</li><li>Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.</li></ul> <br> If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in 1d10 days.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.<br><br><strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.<br><br><strong>Claw</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.<br><br><strong>Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)</strong>: The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons (cold breath or paralyzing breath):<br><br><div><strong>Cold Breath</strong>: The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone.

Though little more than animated energy on their own planes of existence, they can be called on by spellcasters and powerful beings to take shape and perform tasks.<br><br><strong><em> Living Elements.</em></strong> On its home plane, an elemental is a bodiless life force. Its dim consciousness manifests as a physical shape only when focused by the power of magic. A wild spirit of elemental force has no desire except to course through the element of its native plane. Like beasts of the Material Plane, these elemental spirits have no society or culture, and little sense of being.<br><br><strong><em> Conjured by Magic.</em></strong> Certain spells and magic items can conjure an elemental, summoning it from the Inner Planes to the Material Plane. Elementals instinctively resent being pulled from their native planes and bound into service. A creature that summons an elemental must assert force of will to control it.<br><br><strong><em> Bound and Shaped.</em></strong> Powerful magic can bind an elemental spirit into a material template that defines a specific use and function. Invisible stalkers are air elementals bound to a specific form, in the same way that water elementals can be shaped into water weirds.<br><br> The strength of the magic and materials that bind an elemental determines how well the elemental functions in a bound form. Golems are elemental spirits bound to physical forms, but weaker materials such as flesh and clay can’t bind elemental power sufficiently. Durable materials such as stone and iron require stronger magic, which consequently binds an elemental more securely.<br><br><strong><em> Elemental Nature.</em></strong> An elemental doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep.<br><br> <h2>Water Elemental</h2> A water elemental is a cresting wave that rolls across the ground, becoming nearly invisible at it courses through a larger body of water. It engulfs creatures that stand against it, filling their mouths and lungs as easily as it smothers flame.<br><br><div><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.d20.io/images/26322613/XIpPdZVn_eZarR22zICPIA/med.jpg?1481818168\"></div><br> <h2>Traits</h2><strong>Water Form</strong>: The elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br><br><strong>Freeze</strong>: If the elemental takes cold damage, it partially freezes; its speed is reduced by 20 ft. until the end of its next turn.<br><br><h2>Actions</h2><strong>Multiattack</strong>: The elemental makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack</em>: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit</em>: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.<br><br><strong>Whelm (Recharge 4-6)</strong>: Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If it is Large or smaller, it is also grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the elemental's space.<br><br>The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the elemental's turns, each target grappled by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength check and succeeding.<br> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[YTg1MGE4MzE3YzE5]{Temple of Paladine}: P3</li></ul></section>"

Not knowing what it was, they brought the artifact to their king.

The ocean turned red with the blood of slaughtered merfolk, but the ritual worked, and the king led the survivors through the underwater gate to Demogorgon’s layer of the Abyss.

Instead, they drag their rubbery bodies to places where creatures regularly pass, lurking out of sight amid rocky rubble and debris, squeezing into burrows, holes, or crevices, climbing up to ledges, or coiling around stalactites to drop on unwary prey. A grick consumes virtually anything that moves except for other gricks. It targets the nearest prey, grabbing a fallen creature with its tentacles and dragging it off to eat alone.<br><br><strong><em> Roving Ambushers.</em></strong> Gricks remain in an area until the food supply dwindles, often because sentient creatures become aware of their presence and plot alternate routes around their lairs. When prey is scarce in the Underdark, gricks venture aboveground to hunt in the wilderness, lurking in trees or on cliff-side ledges. A grick pack is often led by a single well-fed, oversized alpha around which the others congregate.<br><br><strong><em> Spoils of Slaughter.</em></strong> Over time, grick lairs accumulate the cast-off possessions of intelligent prey, and expert guides know to look out for these telltale signs.

A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can’t feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them. Though they gain no nourishment from the corpses they devour, ghouls are driven by an unending hunger that compels them to consume. A ghoul’s undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.<br><br><strong><em> Abyssal Origins.</em></strong> Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus. Turning against his own people, he feasted on humanoid flesh to honor the Demon Prince of Undeath. As a reward for his service, Orcus transformed Doresain into the first ghoul. Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord’s other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls’ paralytic touch.<br><br><strong><em> Ghasts.</em></strong> Orcus sometimes infuses a ghoul with a stronger dose of abyssal energy, making a ghast.

Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.<br><br><strong><em> The Sleeping Tree Awakens.</em></strong> A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature’s magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.<br><br><strong><em> Legendary Guardians.</em></strong> After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.<br><br><strong><em> Protectors of the Wild.</em></strong> Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby.<br><br> Woodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest’s bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant’s ire. Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant’s wrath.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>False Appearance</strong>: While the treant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.<br><br> <strong>Siege Monster</strong>: The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Multiattack</strong>: The treant makes two slam attacks.<br><br><strong>Slam</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 16 (3d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br> <strong>Rock</strong>: <em>Ranged Weapon Attack:</em> +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.<br><br> <strong>Animate Trees (1/Day)</strong>: The treant magically animates one or two trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action option.

The foremost inhabitants of this inhospitable plane are the toad-like slaadi. Slaadi are undisciplined and have no formal hierarchy, although weaker slaadi obey stronger ones under threat of annihilation.<br><br> <strong><em>The Spawning Stone.</em></strong> Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone’s power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus’s creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus’s massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.<br><br> The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn’t perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.<br><br> <strong><em>Birth and Transformation.</em></strong> Slaadi have horrific cycles of reproduction. Slaadi reproduce either by implanting humanoid hosts with eggs or by infecting them with a transformative disease called chaos phage. Each color of slaad reproduces or transforms in a different way, with red slaadi spawning blue and green slaadi, and blue slaadi spawning red and green. Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.<br><br> <strong><em>Shapechangers.</em></strong> Some slaadi can transform into the humanoid creatures from which they were originally spawned. These slaadi return to the Material Plane to sow discord in the guise of their former selves.<br><br> <h2>Traits</h2> <strong>Magic Resistance</strong>: The slaad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.<br><br> <h2>Actions</h2> <strong>Bite</strong>: <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. <p></p> <hr><section class=\"secret\"><p><strong>GM Notes :</strong> </p><h3>Location(s):</h3><ul><li>@JournalEntry[MmViNGY3NmM2NDBi]{D: Sunward Fortress}: D4, D5</li></ul></section>"

Unlike other draconians, auraks are wingless. This might lull foes into a false sense of security, until the auraks exhale noxious fumes resembling those of their dragon progenitors. Auraks are masterminds and strategists that serve as commanders in the Dragon Armies. They often lead contingents of less powerful draconians.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp. If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on. The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion. If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.</p>"
