A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features. To customize a horror, choose a base creature (flying horror, shadow horror, or skittering horror), then roll once on the Primary Features table and once on the Secondary Features table (or choose an option from each table). Add those features to the base creature.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Primary Features</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d4]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Feature</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\">Avoidance.
