Their mission was clear: to destroy the infernal powers that had corrupted the world and to ensure that those powers never rose again. Strahd, Ulmed, and their companions hunted Fiends, Undead, Aberrations, and other supernatural threats and were tireless foes of cults like the priests of Osybus. When Strahd fell into darkness, Ulmed was heartbroken at his friend's transformation and changed the inquisition's mission. Instead of focusing on hunting monsters, it would also hunt the seeds of evil that can corrupt a person.</p><p>Ulmed and his friends Cosima, Ansel, and Tristian organized the inquisition into three orders, with each one specializing in a type of psionic power. The Order of Cosima harnessed the Mind Fire\u2014their name for the fire of thought that blazes within each person's mind. They used that power to read thoughts, reshape memories, and dominate the recalcitrant. The inquisitors in the Order of Ansel subjected themselves to harsh asceticism in an effort to use psionic energy to empower their own bodies. They succeeded and became the martial arm of the inquisition, represented by a sword. Finally, the Order of Tristian endeavored to use intellect to alter the environment through telekinetic force, and the order's members became the inquisition's scholars, represented by a tome.</p><p>Today the inquisition rules the city of Malitain, a vast city-state to the north of Barovia's original site, and the inquisition sends its members throughout the multiverse, seeking to thwart the work of malevolent cults, otherworldly horrors, and the malice of mortals.

Osybus sought to use others' souls as springboards to his own immortality. He forged pacts with any entity that would give him more power and delved into any eldritch secret that would prolong his life. He became a devotee of the Dark Powers and tapped into their immortal malice to fuel his apotheosis.</p><p>As his power grew, he attracted disciples who also wished to defy life and death. He shared his dread secrets with them and demanded their worship. In time, his goal was achieved: he became a lich of almost godly power. Acknowledging the role that his disciples played in his ascension, Osybus gifted them with a trace of his power. Taking the form of a shadowy tattoo, this boon allows the priests to steal souls as their master did and to cheat death and become undead horrors.</p><p>The threat posed by Osybus and his disciples raised alarms far and wide. In response, the Ulmist Inquisition and the then-mortal Count Strahd von Zarovich faced the lich in battle. Their bravery would have been for naught if Osybus's disciples hadn't betrayed him. Fearing that their master would eventually consume their souls, the disciples aided Osybus's foes and destroyed his physical form. As he perished, he uttered a curse upon them\u2014that their immortality would fail them when they least expected it and that he himself would become one of the Dark Powers. As a result of that curse, a priest of Osybus can't be certain that they will be reborn when they perish.</p><p>In an effort to rid themselves of this curse, they devoted themselves to the same Dark Powers with whom their master had communed. They were given a mission: provide a person of nobility and might to serve as an earthly vessel for these powers to enter the world and conquer it. If they succeeded, their immortality would be assured. A suitable vessel they did then find: Strahd von Zarovich. Working in shadows and through intermediaries, the priests whispered hatred to the count, and when his noble heart was corrupted, they were the ones who laid the path before him that led to the Amber Temple and his fall into vampirism.</p><p>But they were then betrayed. Osybus had not lied; he had himself become one of the Dark Powers, and he and the other Dark Powers had conjured up a misty prison to contain the newly immortal Strahd, thereby preventing the count from serving as the conquering force that the priests sought to loose upon the world; thus they were denied their reward of immortality.</p><p>To this day, the priests of Osybus seek to unleash Strahd from the mists, often using adventurers as their pawns. They also ironically bear their hated founder's name, for they know it is his original deathly gift that gives them their horrific powers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2741\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Boons of Undeath</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[\u2013]</span></span></h2> <p>When a priest of Osybus drops to 0 hit points, the priest might revive with a benefit from the Boons of Undeath table.

Osybus sought to use others' souls as springboards to his own immortality.

He became a devotee of the Dark Powers and tapped into their immortal malice to fuel his apotheosis.</p><p>As his power grew, he attracted disciples who also wished to defy life and death.

Taking the form of a shadowy tattoo, this boon allows the priests to steal souls as their master did and to cheat death and become undead horrors.</p><p>The threat posed by Osybus and his disciples raised alarms far and wide. In response, the Ulmist Inquisition and the then-mortal Count Strahd von Zarovich faced the lich in battle. Their bravery would have been for naught if Osybus's disciples hadn't betrayed him. Fearing that their master would eventually consume their souls, the disciples aided Osybus's foes and destroyed his physical form. As he perished, he uttered a curse upon them\u2014that their immortality would fail them when they least expected it and that he himself would become one of the Dark Powers. As a result of that curse, a priest of Osybus can't be certain that they will be reborn when they perish.</p><p>In an effort to rid themselves of this curse, they devoted themselves to the same Dark Powers with whom their master had communed. They were given a mission: provide a person of nobility and might to serve as an earthly vessel for these powers to enter the world and conquer it. If they succeeded, their immortality would be assured. A suitable vessel they did then find: Strahd von Zarovich. Working in shadows and through intermediaries, the priests whispered hatred to the count, and when his noble heart was corrupted, they were the ones who laid the path before him that led to the Amber Temple and his fall into vampirism.</p><p>But they were then betrayed. Osybus had not lied; he had himself become one of the Dark Powers, and he and the other Dark Powers had conjured up a misty prison to contain the newly immortal Strahd, thereby preventing the count from serving as the conquering force that the priests sought to loose upon the world; thus they were denied their reward of immortality.</p><p>To this day, the priests of Osybus seek to unleash Strahd from the mists, often using adventurers as their pawns. They also ironically bear their hated founder's name, for they know it is his original deathly gift that gives them their horrific powers.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2755\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Boons of Undeath</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[\u2013]</span></span></h2> <p>When a priest of Osybus drops to 0 hit points, the priest might revive with a benefit from the Boons of Undeath table.

Mist horrors can't persist for long outside the Mists: after [[/r 1d4]] rounds outside the Mists, they lose cohesion and collapse back into harmless vapor.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Body Composition</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d4]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Body</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2812\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Aberrant Armor.</span></span> <p>The horror's body is armored in petrified wood, alien crystal, rusted mechanisms, sculpted stone, or an exoskeleton.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2813\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Loathsome Limbs.</span></span> <p>The horror's body boasts spider like legs, many-jointed appendages, or thrashing tentacles.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2814\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Malleable Mass.</span></span> <p>The horror's body is composed of a clot of boneless flesh, shadowy tendrils, or mist.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2815\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Oozing Organs.</span></span> <p>The horror's body boasts exposed entrails, bloated parasites, or a gelatinous shroud, perhaps because it is inside out.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Hex Blast</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d4]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Hex</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2816\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beguiling Hex (Recharge [[/r 1d6]] (5\u20136)).</span></span> <p>The horror expels a wave of mind-altering magic.

Mist horrors can't persist for long outside the Mists: after [[/r 1d4]] rounds outside the Mists, they lose cohesion and collapse back into harmless vapor.</p><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Body Composition</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d4]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Body</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2826\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Aberrant Armor.</span></span> <p>The horror's body is armored in petrified wood, alien crystal, rusted mechanisms, sculpted stone, or an exoskeleton.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"2\" data-roll-max=\"2\">2</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2827\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Loathsome Limbs.</span></span> <p>The horror's body boasts spider like legs, many-jointed appendages, or thrashing tentacles.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"3\" data-roll-max=\"3\">3</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2828\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Malleable Mass.</span></span> <p>The horror's body is composed of a clot of boneless flesh, shadowy tendrils, or mist.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"4\" data-roll-max=\"4\">4</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2829\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Oozing Organs.</span></span> <p>The horror's body boasts exposed entrails, bloated parasites, or a gelatinous shroud, perhaps because it is inside out.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table><table class=\"w-100 rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Hex Blast</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d4]]</th><th class=\"col-10\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Hex</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-2 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"1\">1</td><td class=\"col-10\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"2830\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Beguiling Hex (Recharge [[/r 1d6]] (5\u20136)).</span></span> <p>The horror expels a wave of mind-altering magic.
