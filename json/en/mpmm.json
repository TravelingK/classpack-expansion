He likes to tempt frost giants with dreams of glory followed by nightmares of bloody cannibalism. Those who don't shrink from such visions or report them to priests of Thrym receive more of the same. If a frost giant comes to relish these dreams and nightmares, as some do, Vaprak sets a troll upon a sacred quest to find the frost giant and meet the giant in secret. The troll offers up its own body to be devoured in Vaprak's name. Only the boldest and most determined frost giants can finish such a gory feast.</p><p>After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, resulting in discolored skin; warty scars; and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by their clan.

They bring an emotional intensity to their lives, whether they're exploring neighboring tunnels, defending their homes, engaging with their families, or crafting bold new works.

Similarly, duergar tend to be very community-minded\u2014in the Underdark, all must cooperate to survive.</p><p>Among the duergar of the Forgotten Realms, creation is a fiercely passionate process.

I fail to see the appeal.</i>\u201d</p><p><span class=\"rd__quote-by\">\u2014 Mordenkainen</span></p><p>Mind flayers that pursue arcane magic are exiled as deviants, and for them no everlasting communion with an elder brain is possible. The road to lichdom offers an alternative way to escape the permanency of death, but that path is long and fraught with barriers. Alhoons are mind flayers who have used a shortcut to attain a lichlike state.</p><p>Elder brains forbid mind flayers from pursuing magic power aside from psionics, but it isn't an interdiction they must often enforce. Illithids brook no masters but members of their own kind, so it isn't in their nature to bow to any god or otherworldly patron. However, wizardry remains a temptation. In the pages of a spellbook, an illithid sees a system to acquire authority. Through the writings of the wizard who penned it, the illithid perceives the workings of a highly intelligent mind. Most mind flayers who find a spellbook react with abhorrence or indifference, but for some, a spellbook is a gateway to a new way of thinking.</p><p>For a time, the study of such forbidden texts can be hidden from other illithids and even from an elder brain. Yet eventually, mind flayer arcanists determined to pursue wizardry must flee the colony for their own safety. Once they taste freedom from the colony, some prize their privacy, others seek to commune with similar minds, and still others seek to dominate a colony by elevating themselves to the position of leadership normally held by an elder brain. Regardless, all such arcanists face the same stark fact: when they die, they will not join the host of minds in the elder brain\u2014deviant minds are never accepted as part of the collective. For them, death means oblivion.</p><p>Lichdom offers salvation and the prospect of being able to pursue knowledge indefinitely. Yet learning the secret of achieving lichdom requires an arcane spellcaster to be at the apex of power\u2014a significant challenge for mind flayers, given the scarcity of available mentors and training.</p><p>Confronting this reality, a group of nine mind flayer arcanists used their arcane magic and psionics to weave a new truth. These nine called themselves the Alhoon, and those who follow in their footsteps are referred to by the same name.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"2867\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Collaborative Undeath</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[\u2013]</span></span></h2> <p>To become alhoons, mind flayer arcanists must cooperate in the creation of a periapt of mind trapping, a fist-sized container made of silver, emerald, and amethyst. The process requires at least three mind flayer arcanists and the sacrifice of an equal number of souls from living victims in a three-day-long ritual of spellcasting and psionic communion. Upon its completion, free-willed undeath is conferred on the mind flayers, turning them into alhoons.</p><p>Initially, an alhoon can be difficult to distinguish from a normal mind flayer. The most obvious difference is the lack of a mind flayer's ever-present mucus coating. Without that protection, an alhoon's skin becomes dry and cracked, and its eyes might appear shriveled and sunken. Both of these clues are easily missed by someone who hasn't seen a mind flayer. However, in short order, an alhoon's flesh withers away and its empty eye sockets gleam with cold pinpricks of light like those of other liches.</p><p>Unlike a true lich's phylactery, the periapt of mind trapping doesn't restore the alhoons to undeath if they are destroyed. Instead, a destroyed alhoon's mind is transferred to the periapt, where it remains in communion with any other trapped alhoon minds, as well as the souls of those sacrificed.</p><p>The undeath conferred by a periapt of mind trapping lasts only so long as the life of the living victim selected. Thus an alhoon who sacrificed a 200-year-old elf looks forward to a much longer existence than one that sacrificed a 35-year-old person. Alhoons can extend their existence by repeating the ritual with new victims, effectively resetting the clocks for themselves.</p><p>Destroying a periapt of mind trapping consigns those trapped within it to oblivion, and thus alhoons often work together to create elaborate protections for their periapt and their preferred ritual site. Sometimes a single alhoon is entrusted with the periapt of mind trapping, but this is a dangerous proposition. Anyone who holds the periapt gains advantage on attacks, saving throws, and checks against the alhoons associated with its creation, and those alhoons in turn suffer disadvantage on attacks, saving throws, and checks against the holder. In addition, the holder can telepathically communicate with any sacrificed soul trapped within, and alhoons within the periapt can speak telepathically with the holder. A creature carrying the periapt can't prevent communication from alhoons but can silence trapped souls.</p></div>"}}}, "items": {"Multiattack": {"name": "Multiattack", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The alhoon makes two Chilling Grasp or Arcane Bolt attacks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Chilling Grasp": {"name": "Chilling Grasp", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Melee Spell Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+8]] (+8) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 14 ([[/r 4d6]]) cold damage, and the alhoon regains 14 hit points.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Arcane Bolt": {"name": "Arcane Bolt", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Ranged Spell Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+8]] (+8) to hit, range 120 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 28 ([[/r 8d6]]) force damage.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Mind Blast": {"name": "Mind Blast", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The alhoon magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone.

In the Outer Planes, ki-rins in service to benevolent deities take a direct role in the eternal struggle between good and evil. In the mortal world, ki-rins are celebrated far and wide as harbingers of destiny, guardians of the sacred, and counterbalances to the forces of evil.</p><p>Ki-rins are an embodiment of good, and simply beholding one can evoke fear or awe in an observer. A typical ki-rin looks like a muscular stag, covered in golden scales lined in some places with golden fur. It has a long mane and tail, coppery cloven hooves, and a spiral-shaped coppery horn just above and between its luminous violet eyes. In a breeze or when aloft, the creature's scales and hair appear to blaze with a holy, golden fire.</p><p>Beyond their coloration, ki-rins vary in appearance based on the deity each one reveres and the function each typically performs in service to that god. Some resemble gigantic unicorns; these are often used as guardians. Others have draconic features and tend to be aggressive foes of evil. Having one horn is most common, but a particularly fierce ki-rin might have two horns or a set of antlers like those of a great stag.</p><p>In many lands, common folk view ki-rins as heralds of good fortune. They consider seeing a ki-rin fly overhead a blessing and events that happen on such a day especially auspicious. If a ki-rin alights during a ceremony such as a birth announcement or a coronation, everyone present understands that the creature is telling them the person so honored could become a great force for good. Ki-rins have also been known to appear at the sites of great battles to inspire and strengthen the side of good or to rescue heroes from certain death.</p><p>Ki-rins are attracted to the worship of deities of courage, loyalty, selflessness, and truth, as well as to the advancement of just societies. For instance, in the Forgotten Realms, ki-rins rally mostly to Torm, although they also serve his allies Tyr and Ilmater. Ki-rins that serve good deities go wherever they are commanded; a ki-rin from an Upper Plane might venture to the Material Plane on a mission, usually as a scout, a messenger, or a spy. A ki-rin living on the Material Plane claims a territory to watch over, and one ki-rin might safeguard an area that encompasses several nations.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3300\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Lair of Luxury</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"> <span class=\"rd__title-link \">p161</span><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[\u2013]</span></span></h2> <p>On the celestial planes, ki-rins reside in lofty, elegant aeries filled with luxurious objects. On the Material Plane, a ki-rin chooses a similar location for its lair, such as atop a tall pinnacle or within a cloud solidified by the ki-rin's magic. The chosen location is almost always hard to reach, and only those mortals who have the tenacity to complete the daunting journey to a ki-rin's lair can prove themselves worthy of speaking with its occupant. Many of those who do end up pledging service to the creature. They study under its tutelage in its lair and serve as its agents in the world. These followers might travel incognito across the land, seeking news of growing evil and working behind the scenes, or they might be champions of their master's cause, out to defeat villainy wherever it is found.</p><p>When viewed from the outside, a ki-rin's lair is indistinguishable from a natural site, and the entrance is difficult for visitors to find and reach. Inside, the lair is a serene and comfortable place, its ambiance a mix between palace and temple.

When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on a dire troll, the dire troll's regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into the troll's own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and organs that dire trolls tear from their victims and graft onto themselves in this manner.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--0\"><h1 class=\"rd__h rd__h--0\" data-title-index=\"3013\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Trolls</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[\u2013]</span></span></h1> <p>Trolls that are nearly obliterated but survive and regenerate from mere scraps of flesh can display bizarre features. Radically transformed trolls like the rot trolls, spirit trolls, and venom trolls that follow are especially likely to arise when trolls regenerate in the presence of magical emanations, planar energy, disease, or death on a vast scale, or if their bodies were damaged by elemental forces. These unusual forms can also be produced and shaped by the ritual magic of evil spellcasters or by trolls' own practices, as is the case for dire trolls.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--1\"><h2 class=\"rd__h rd__h--1\" data-title-index=\"3014\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Vaprak the Destroyer</span><span class=\"ve-flex-vh-center\"><span class=\"rd__h-toggle ml-2 clickable\" data-rd-h-toggle-button=\"true\">[\u2013]</span></span></h2> <p>Although trolls are rarely devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, some fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer.

Attacking the possessed goblin is foolhardy, and killing them just prompts the spirit to possess another goblin. The only way to keep a nilbog from wreaking havoc is to treat it well and give it respect and praise.</p><p>Among fey courts, the risk of attracting a nilbog has given rise to the practice of always including at least one goblin jester. This jester is allowed to go anywhere and do whatever they please, hopefully preventing a nilbog from manifesting.

Most live in colonies in the Underdark and fight the enemies of the Demon Queen of Spiders. Long ago, the cult of Lolth first subjected elf prisoners to horrible rituals that transformed them into creatures with both elven and spider traits, which their creators dubbed chitines. The intention was to create servile warriors dedicated first to the cult and then, only by association with it, to Lolth. The goddess found this arrangement unacceptable.</p><p>As punishment, the Spider Queen twisted her worshipers' rituals. The process usually transformed subjects into the spindly creatures her devotees expected, but occasionally, an elf changed into a choldrith: an arachnid Monstrosity able to command and create more chitines on its own. These choldriths soon led the chitines to rebel and abandon their creators, founding free colonies elsewhere in the Underdark. On occasion, though, colonies can be found in remote, gloomy areas of the surface world, warring against Lolth's enemies.</p><p>The cult of Lolth still creates chitines as the need arises. Outside the presence of a choldrith, chitines make good workers, and they can be useful if the cult finds an independent chitine colony and want to infiltrate it. If the creation process yields a choldrith, though, the cult destroys the creature.</p><p>As servants of Lolth, chitines love spiders. They rear spiders and similar arachnids, such as cave fishers (also in this book). Chitine colonies erect shrines to Lolth that serve as beacons, attracting spiders and other beings that serve her. Anywhere chitines set up a colony quickly becomes a webshrouded, gloomy, and treacherous place.</p><p>Chitines resemble spiders, but they behave more like social insects such as ants. They are divided into worker and warrior castes; choldriths, when present, occupy the top levels of a colony's hierarchy. Each chitine has a social position that comes with duties related to that rank, and all are expected to sacrifice themselves to protect the colony's choldriths. Every chitine has spinnerets and slowly produces webbing that is used to build floors, walls, structures, objects, and traps that benefit the colony. A warrior might be responsible for crafting web armor (which is as tough as hide or leather), while a group of workers might be tasked to dig pit traps and cover them with fragile webbing disguised with loose dirt to appear as a solid surface.</p>"}}}, "items": {"Multiattack": {"name": "Multiattack", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The chitine makes three Dagger attacks.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Dagger (Melee)": {"name": "Dagger (Melee)", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+4]] (+4) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 4 ([[/r 1d4 + 2]]) piercing damage.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Dagger (Ranged)": {"name": "Dagger (Ranged)", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p><i>Ranged Weapon Attack:</i> [[/r 1d20+4]] (+4) to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 4 ([[/r 1d4 + 2]]) piercing damage.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Fey Ancestry": {"name": "Fey Ancestry", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The chitine has advantage on saving throws against being @condition[charmed], and magic can't put the chitine to sleep.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Sunlight Sensitivity": {"name": "Sunlight Sensitivity", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>While in sunlight, the chitine has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (@skill[Perception]) checks that rely on sight.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Web Sense": {"name": "Web Sense", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>While in contact with a web, the chitine knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Web Walker": {"name": "Web Walker", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>The chitine ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>"}}}, "Hide Armor": {"name": "Hide Armor", "system": {"description": {"value": "<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--2\"><p>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts.
